Those really guide student through the book and take most use of it and show that adding those into the book makes it perfectly good for readers to practice it immediatly. The only thing is that i don't see much connection yet in the Table of content. It just like when you need, you open the book to find it and use it. It not really a good way for one to learn by oneself. Maybe what i just praise is my imaginary. But we can't say that yet if we haven't take a look at it carefully}} {{cloze tư duy kiểu làm giáo trình như làm một cuốn sách hướng dẫn, nghĩ và làm dựa vào cái cảm hứng hướng dẫn nó sẽ giúp mày khá nhiều đấy}}

							- Because the Internet makes the world a smaller place, the value of having a common language is greatly increased. **The question is-which language?** Because the Internet grew up in the United States, the largest percentage of its content is now in English. Bill Gates, Microsoft's president, believes that English will remain valuable for a long time as a common language for international communication. He says, "Unless you read English passably well, you miss out on some of the Internet experience".

							- Someday, software may be available to instantly translate both written and spoken language so well that the need for any common language could decline. That day is decades away, however, because flawless machine translation is a very tough problem.  Software that does crudes translations already exists. It is useful if all you are trying to do is understand the general idea of something you see on your computer screen. However, if you are trying to negotiate a contract or discuss a scientific subject where details are important, machine translation is totally useless (Gates).

							- Even when you try to be polite, it is easy to do the wrong thing inadvertently in a new culture. For example, when someone offers you food or a beverage in the United States, accept it the first time it is offered. If you say, "No, thank you" because it is polite to decline the first one or two offers in your culture, you could become very hungry and thirsty in the United States. There, a host thinks that"no" means "no" and will usually not offer again

							- Although North Americans are usually very direct in social matters, there are a few occasions when they are not. If a North American says, "Please drop by sometime," he mayor may not want you to visit him in his home. Your clue that this may not be a real invitation is the word "sometime." In some areas of the United States, people do not expect you to visit them unless you have an invitation for a specific day and time. In other areas of the United States, however, "dropping by" is a friendly, neighborly gesture.

						- English has almost become an international language. Except for Chinese, more people speak English than any other language. Spanish is the official language of more countries in the world, but more countries have English as their official or unofficial second language. More than 70 percent of the world's mail is written in English. It is the primary language on the Internet. In international business, English is used more than any other language, and it is the language of airline pilots and air traffic controllers all over the world. Moreover, although French used to be the language of diplomacy, English has displaced it throughout the world. Therefore, unless you plan to spend your life alone on a desert island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, English is a useful language to know.

During training, when dolphins do something correctly, they squeal excitedly and race toward their trainer. When dolphins make a mistake, however, they droop noticeably and mope around their pool. Furthermore, dolphins help each other when they are in trouble. lf a dolphin is sick, it sends out a message, and others in the area swim to help it. They push the sick dolphin to the surface of the water so that it can breathe. They stay with it for days or weeks until it recovers or dies. Dolphins have also helped trapped or lost whales navigate their way safely out to the open sea. Dolphins are so intelligent and helpful, in fact, that the U.S. Navy is training them to become underwater bomb disposal experts.

					- "Throw me something, mister," is the customary plea for a **Mardi Gras "throw"**. In the final days of Mardi Gras, the season of parties, parades, and revelry that precedes the Christian period of fasting and penance called Lent, crowds of spectators line the streets of New Orleans. They hope to catch a **Mardi Gras souvenir** tossed from parading floats. Mardi Gras organizations called "krewes" build the floats and sponsor the parades, and while cruising along parade routes, costumed krewe members throw **plastic trinkets** to the crowds below. **The trinkets**, which are called **"throws"**, consist of bead necklaces, coins, cups, toys, Frisbees, and figurines stamped with the krewe's symbol or the parade theme. **Mardi Gras throws** are big business for the companies that supply **them**. Krewe members spend an average of $800 on **them**, and some spend $2,000 or more. By far the most treasured of the **Mardi Gras mementos** are gaudy bead necklaces. Originally made of glass, **they** are now made of plastic (Roach).

					- Olympic athletes must be strong both physically and mentally. First of all, if athletes hope to compete in an Olympic sport, they must be physically strong. Furthermore, aspiring Olympians must train rigorously for many years. For the most demanding sports, they train several hours a day, five or six days a week, for ten or more years. In addition to being physically strong, athletes must also be mentally tough. This means that they have to be totally dedicated to their sport, often giving up a normal school, family, and social life. Being mentally strong also means that he or she must be able to withstand the intense pressure of international competition with its accompanying media coverage. Finally, not everyone can win a medal, so Olympians must possess the inner strength to live with defeat.
