			- The most important sentence in a paragraph
			  id:: 6321c8f2-7922-4929-a0bf-7af7a5dbbcde
				- {{cloze why do i chose this sentence to be a main idea, though it's vague without explaination? Cause we do have same level idea, also it can be main: ((6321c945-6a7f-4ce0-a817-ab54a9429fdf)), but the writer and the reader will be left out and be the same level with ((6321c8f2-7922-4929-a0bf-7af7a5dbbcde)), which isn't good since you will see no logical transmit in the structure. So i choose the first one that has the same words}}
				- It is a helpful guide to both the writer and reader

						  hl-page:: 14
						  ls-type:: annotation
						  id:: 6321cacb-3580-472d-9eed-5ea7e43b8c6f
			- Important points
				- {{cloze when choosing the main idea, you can simply exclude the part to remember, unless you really want to remind yourself. And i dont need to look through all the main idea that i or somebody have made. This is how i think about it. So it might not be the best but still the advice does show when to use what and exclude the worse option}}

				- 3.
					- most general statement in the paragraph
						- it gives only the main idea
						- does not give any specific details
					- example + explaination
						- {{cloze i did not divide cause the example isn't for the main idea, it more like a-similar-example - a kind of explaination}}
						- the name of a particular course on a restaurant menu
						  ls-type:: annotation
						  hl-page:: 15
						  id:: 6321ce35-390a-41ca-8302-a99110f26622
						- When you order food in a restaurant, you want to know more about a particular course than just "meat" or "soup" or "salad." You want to know generally what kind of salad it is. Potato salad? Mixed green salad? Fruit salad? However, you do not necessarily want to know all the ingredients
						  ls-type:: annotation
						  hl-page:: 15
						  id:: 6321ce6e-9fc9-402a-ba82-fc125722cbb6
						- Similarly, a reader wants to know generally what to expect in a paragraph, but he or she does not want to learn all the details in the first sentence.
						  ls-type:: annotation
						  hl-page:: 15
						  id:: 6321ce7a-5147-4de6-bb68-9023fcb2828c
					- {{cloze dividing parts like this helps you to understand all of it better than just collect information by wander-reading, you can simple go with the flow and easily forgeting about the part you read long ago, or skip to any parts that you want}}
						- Following is a general statement that could serve as a topic sentence. 
						  ls-type:: annotation
						  hl-page:: 15
						  id:: 6321cffc-4630-4a2c-a415-0fab0246a04e
							- The Arabic origin of many English words is not always obvious.
						- The following sentence, on the other hand, is too specific. It could serve as a supporting sentence but not as a topic sentence.
							- The slang expression so long (meaning "good-bye") is probably a corruption of the Arabic salaam.
						- This sentence is too general.
							- English has been influenced by other languages.
					-
		- Position
			- the topic sentence is usually (but not always) the first in a paragraph
				- experienced writers sometimes put it in other locations
				- but still the best spot is right at the beginning
					- readers who used to the English way of writing want to know what they will read about as soon as they begin reading
						- {{cloze defining and contrasting different ways of writing by country, characteristics, region or whatever i don't know, i'm nervous cause i have passed the deadline due  }}
