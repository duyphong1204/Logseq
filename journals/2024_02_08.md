  Listening to lots of music is one of the essential starting points for creating a solid mix. You need to know your music inside out! As you listen to music, try to pick out any isolated elements in the track; a vocal that sits nicely by itself or a groovy bassline. There may be a funky drum section or a melody exposed from the rest of the song.⁠

  Whether you are downloading or streaming, there are so many good sources of music. DJ pools are a great place to start; you pay a subscription and can download as many tracks as you want. Ideal for getting your music library bulked up. Then there is streaming; websites like Beatport or beatsource allow you to store up to 1k tracks offline now, so don’t worry about not having an internet connection at your gigs!⁠

  Now it’s time to organise. Put all your tracks into intro folders/playlists; There are several ways you can do this. The most obvious one is by genre, but you can take it further and introduce sub-genres, years of tracks, e.g. the 2010s, 2020s etc. you can even organise by energy, e.g. warm up, main set, end of the night.⁠

  Setting hot cues will help with performance. Set up a minimum of 2 hot cues but ideally around 4, first on the intro, second on the breakdown or the first verse, a third on the drop or the chorus and a final one on the outro. This will make mixing a lot more fun and engaging and can help you visually when mixing too.⁠

  Mixing in key isn’t essential, but depending on what genre you play, nothing sounds better than layering two tracks that are in key, creating epic transitions. Plus, if you’re using acapellas to make mashups, having your playlist organised by key can make this process much more streamlined.⁠

- Normally I shoot hand held. But I’ll admit, there was a time I preferred a gimbal for everything so here are 5 reasons why I personally quit using a gimbal.
  collapsed:: true
  1. rack focusing: I’m a sucker for controlling focus, which requires you to essentially pull on the lens to focus your subject. Without a million pricey accessories and tons of set-up time you can’t successfully rack focus with a gimbal.
  2. I find myself in lower budget, fast paced/hazardous shooting environments more commonly than not and being hired as a run and gun videographer, I’ve been accustomed to leaving the gimbal at home.
  3. Advancements in technology - It seems that every few months, there’s a new piece of equipment; due to reason #2 I’ve learned how to not get trapped in the black hole of purchasing new dazzling equipment (though I am definitely missing a few important things not related to electronics)
  4. Natural camera movement- IMO footage captured from a gimbal setup is too stable, I like to incorporate natural movement and more precise subject recognition. Gimbals can get very jerky and due to the run and gun process of things at the moment, some clients don’t care to spend the time on individual shots to make their story more compelling but instead get the information out as fast as possible (which is understandable)
  5. Another thing to charge. (I only have so many outlets and usb chords) the amount of equipment in the film industry that needs to be charged for a shoot to go correctly is absolutely asinine)
  Ps. This is only my opinion, now that the world of content is changing, I’m actually planning on using the gimbal more in the future.
	- I handheld a lot also because of the control you have over the camera but I do have very shaky hands which I hate lol but there’s a lot of simple things to fix both scenarios you mentioned. Like Zhiyun gimbals comes with follow focus or get a simple focus puller attached to the gimbal. And there’s Catalyst browse or Gyroflow is a better plugin for stabilizing shaky footage if your camera has gyro metadata and both plugins are free.
		- [@abe.link](https://www.instagram.com/abe.link/) so for some reason my [@zhiyun_tech](https://www.instagram.com/zhiyun_tech/) crane 2 came with the wheel on the side but not focus motor back in the day. Then I just never bought one because I folded and went back to handheld.
		  I need to look into gyroflow and catalyst browse, I appreciate the tip!

	  Agree. Things seem stiff and claustrophobic when shooting on a gimbal. Maybe for real estate that cookie cutter look is needed. But you know how that goes.

		- @darnell_knight stability is definitely needed for certain shots!
