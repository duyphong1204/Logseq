Moreover, not only those demands were not heard, but the people of the Thirteen Colonies was also had to suffered more severe domination from the British as listed in the Indictment section.

- Despite of the fact that most usurpation was done by the king, he could not be the only to blame for the maltreatment of the American colonies. After the reign of Charles I, the Parliament was established to control the king, changing the country into a consitutional monarchy, limiting the power of the king. For this reason, for king George III to act on his own is impossible, especially in implementing legislation. In fact, it was mention in the Indictment part that the king "has combined with others to subject".
