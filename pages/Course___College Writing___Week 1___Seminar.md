- Understand and find as much as renaissance keyword as possible
- Shall I compare you to a summer day?
- You are more lovely and moderate
- Harsh wind disturb the delicate buds of May
- and summer doesn not last long enough
- Sometimes the sun is too hot
- and its golden face is dimmed by the cloud
- All beautiful things become less beautiful,
- either by the experience of life or the passing of time
- but your eternal beauty wont fade, nor lose any of its quality
- And you will never die, as you will live on in my enduring poetry
- As long as people are still alive to read poem, this sonnet will live
- and you will live in it
