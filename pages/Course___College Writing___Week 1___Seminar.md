- Understand and find as much as renaissance keyword as possible
- Should do some close reading for sonnet as well:
- 4 lines, rhyme in last syllable (first quartet) -> (octave) - 1 arguments -> trouve? -> setet
- Sonnet 1 -> 126 the speak of poem = lover, target = beloved (young male/fair youth) (after this is a human)
- 1-1 is the best? 1 tutor or more for one student (is still arguably the best) - no write, just talk?
- logical devision: defition, logic, time, cause - effect, classification, descriptive logic, listing
- Sonnet 18
	- compare and contrast
	- the beloved and nature
		- nature is extreme
		- "changing course untrimm" meaning is lost
	- renaissance
		- focus on human
		- art keep nature better than nature
		- plato beauty is stable
- Sonnet 126
	- definition essay
	- disclaimer (to pro)
	- remover to remove has lost its meaning

- Shall I compare you to a summer day?
- You are more lovely and moderate
- Harsh wind disturb the delicate buds of May
- and summer doesn not last long enough
- Sometimes the sun is too hot
- and its golden face is dimmed by the cloud
- All beautiful things become less beautiful,
- either by the experience of life or the passing of time
- but your eternal beauty wont fade, nor lose any of its quality
- And you will never die, as you will live on in my enduring poetry
- As long as people are still alive to read poem, this sonnet will live
- and you will live in it
