- Supporting Materials
  collapsed:: true
	- **Examples**
	  collapsed:: true
		- He illustrates that "we smile everyday"
			- We smile when our dog licks us in the face.
			- We smile when we see a surprise birthday present.
			- Sometimes, a smile can be even as simple
			- as hearing the rain tapping clickety-click on your doorstep,
			- or maybe completing a new X-box challenge.
	- He then leads to a question about the smile: what is a smile and answer it by giving a **scientific Definition** (specialized dictionary):
	  collapsed:: true
		- A smile is the peak of emotions, it is the highest emotional content.
		- It is like the extreme sensation of joy and of happiness.
	- After that, he follows his answer with another question: what does the brain do?
	- This time he explained using another kind of definition
		- a **functional definition** with **visual aid**
			- And that time, the neuronal signals are going to travel to the sensory cortex of your brain. From there, it is going to be carried down to your brainstem, which is the oldest part of your brain.
			- From there, the cranium muscle is going to carry these neuronal signalseven further down towards your smiling muscles, generating a smile.
		- and again
			- a smile is a very instantaneous process.
				- After the contraction of our mouth muscle,
				- it is going to send a feedback loop back to our brain,
				- signalling that we are feeling good enhancing our sensation of joy.
	- He also uses **testimony** with **analogies** to signify the important of a smile
		- According to some recent research
			- a smile could be as worthy as 2,000 pounds of chocolate or $16,000
	- And **narratives** to help the audience understands in a more interesting way the message why he was there
		- So, this story...
- Guidelines
	- Choose the Most Credible Proof
		- most of his supporting materials are proven (examples is not needed, narratives also, but science definition and testimony may; however, i believe he cut it off for the talk to sound less boring)
	- Use a variety of supporting materials
		- he did utilized differents supporting materials for many purpose
			- examples for easier understanding
			- definition to logically describe the fact, the actual mechanism behind something
		- although i can say for sure has he choose wisely (there is a better way, a better structure t use when talking about this topic) or not, at least the talk wasn't boring
	- Appeal to different learning styles
		- he has visual aids for visual learners and has combined testimony and analogies for verbal learners
		- also asked many thought-provoking questions for people to reflect and their attention attracted to the talk
