	  Your (4) heart can see that this love is enough
	  And I'd give everything for one more try
	  You know I wanna be your destiny, so please just say hello
	  This love is (5) haunting me, and I just need to know
	  And all the memories are keeping me awake at night
	  I'm still not over you, there's nothing I could do
	  You know I wanna be your (6) destiny, so please just say hello
	  This love is haunting me, and I just need to know
	  And all the (7) memories are keeping me awake at night
	  I'm still not over you, there's nothing I could do

	  "In the vibrant tapestry of a student's love life, emotions often weave a complex and colorful pattern. As young hearts embark on this journey, they may shy away from expressing their feelings, unsure of what to say or how to throw themselves into the adventure of love. Yet, with time, they will find their way, guided by the wisdom of laughter and the warmth of shared experiences. Love, like a delicate thread of wool, has the power to mend and strengthen the bonds between two souls. As these relationships grow, they learn that sometimes saying "bye" can be the most difficult part, yet it's a testament to the beautiful moments they've shared. Through the ups and downs, students learn that love is a vital aspect of their personal growth, an essential part of their unique journey."
