			- The *immune* system protects your body from sickness and germs.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *Antibodies* are white blood cells that seek out and destroy organisms or substances that can cause disease.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *Lymph nodes* are glands that work like filters to remove germs. They're found in your neck, armpits, and other areas.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Cells that chew up invading germs are called *phagocytes*
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *Lymphocytes *are the cells that recognize invaders like germs.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Leukocytes travel through the body through lymphatic *vessel*
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- A foreign substance that invades your body is called an *antigen*
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  8. When your body detects an antigen, *leukocytes* are made and lock onto it. Once an antigen is recognized, your immune system can remember it the next time and protect you from getting sick again.
			- Humans are born with *innate* immunity

		- IV. Read the following passage about immunization and vaccination then discuss in groups the given questions
		- The Immune System
		- The human body often takes care of itself without the person who owns the body knows what is happening. The body takes care itself through its immune system. The immune system is in charge of
