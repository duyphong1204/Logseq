- # Physical Geography Of Scotland
	- ## Topography
		- Scotland has three fairly clearly marked regions.
			- Just north of the border with England are the Southern Uplands,
				- an area of small towns,
				- quite far apart from each other,
				- whose economy depends to a large extent on sheep farming.
			- Further north, there is the Central Plain.
			- Finally, there are the Highlands,
				- consisting of
					- mountains
					- deep valleys
					- including numerous small islands off the west coast
				- This area of spectacular natural beauty
					- occupies the same land area as southern England
						- but fewer than a million people live there.
			- It is in the central plain and the strip of east coast extending northwards from it that
				- more than 80% of the population of Scotland lives
				- in recent times, this region has had many of the same difficulties as the industrial north of England
					- although the North Sea oil industry has helped to keep unemployment down.
	- ## Weather and climate
		- Like the climate of the rest of Britain, that of Scotland is subject to the moderating Influences of the surrounding seas.
			- As a result of these influences, the outstanding climatic leatures are
				- extreme seasonal variations are rare
				- temperate winters
				- cool summers Low temperatures, however, are common during the winter season in the mountainous districts of the interior. In the western coastal region, which is subject to the moderating effects of the Gulf Stream, conditions are somewhat milder than in the east. The average January temperature of the eastern coastal region is 4°C, and the average January temperature of the western coastal region is 30C; corresponding July averages are 14°C and 15°C. The average January and July temperatures for the city of Edinburgh are 3°C and 14°C, respectively. Precipitation, which is marked by regional variations, ranges from about 3800mm annually in the western Highlands to 635mm annually in certain eastern areas.
- Scotland has rich popular weather lore. In fact, these saying fall into two groups: forecasting weather and forecasting climate. Climatic forecasts, those sayings which predict summer rainfall from observing when species of tree come into leaf, or severity of the coming winter from the time of migration of certain birds, have little validity. But familiarity with the local topography can enable a reasonable forecast of weather within the next few hours to be made, if the wind direction, temperature and humidity are known. Over hundred, or thousands, of years, people have recorded these weather signs in the form of proverbs, such as the familiar 'red sky at night, shepherd's delight. Or the description of Scottish weather by Buff Hardie:
- Rughadh shuas an a'm laidhe,
- Dh' eireadh Unionn moch's a mhaduinn:
- Rughadh Shuas's a'mhoch mhaduinn
- Dheanadh Fionn an ath-chadal.
- With a rody sky at bedtime
- Fingla would rise early
- With a rosy sky at dawn
- He would take another sleep.
