	- Scotland
		- or in Gaelic, *Alba*
		- is a country (formerly an independent kingdom) of northwest Europe
		- occupying the northern third of the island of Great Britain.
	- In the United Kingdom, Scotland is the second-largest nation (after England).
	- Scotland was first united with England in 1603

			- though some aspects, notably Scotland's legal system, did remain separate
	- In 1999, Scotland received its own devolved home rule parliament to govern the country on purely domestic matters.
- # Physical Geography Of Scotland
	- ## Topography
		- Scotland has three fairly clearly marked regions.
			- Just north of the border with England are the Southern Uplands
				- an area of small towns,
				- quite far apart from each other,
				- whose economy depends to a large extent on sheep farming.
			- Further north, there is the Central Plain.
			- Finally, there are the Highlands
				- consisting of
					- mountains
					- deep valleys
					- including numerous small islands off the west coast
				- This area of spectacular natural beauty
					- occupies the same land area as southern England
						- but fewer than a million people live there.
				- It is in the central plain and the strip of east coast extending northwards from it that
					- more than 80% of the population of Scotland lives
					- in recent times, this region has had many of the same difficulties as the industrial north of England
						- although the North Sea oil industry has helped to keep unemployment down.
	- ## Weather and climate
		- Like the climate of the rest of Britain, that of Scotland is subject to the moderating Influences of the surrounding seas.
			- As a result of these influences,
				- extreme seasonal variations are rare
				- the outstanding climatic features are
					- temperate winters
					- cool summers
		- Low temperatures, however, are common during the winter season in the mountainous districts of the interior.
		- In the western coastal region, which is subject to the moderating effects of the Gulf Stream, conditions are somewhat milder than in the east.
			- the average January temperature of the eastern coastal region is 4°C
			- the average January temperature of the western coastal region is 30C
			- corresponding July averages are 14°C and 15°C
			- the average January and July temperatures for the city of Edinburgh are 3°C and 14°C, respectively.
		- Precipitation
			- which is marked by regional variations
			- ranges from
				- about 3800mm annually in the western Highlands
				- to 635mm annually in certain eastern areas.
		- Scotland has rich popular weather lore.
			- In fact, these saying fall into two groups:
				- Forecasting climate.
					- Climatic forecasts, those sayings which predict summer rainfall from observing have little validity.
						- when species of tree come into leaf
						- severity of the coming winter from the time of migration of certain birds
				- Forecasting weather
					- But familiarity with the local topography can enable a reasonable forecast of weather within the next few hours to be made
						- if the wind direction, temperature and humidity are known.
					- Over hundred, or thousands, of years, people have recorded these weather signs in the form of proverbs,
						- such as
							- the familiar 'red sky at night
							- shepherd's delight.
						- Or the description of Scottish weather by Buff Hardie:
							- | | |
							  | Rughadh shuas an a'm laidhe, | With a rody sky at bedtime |
							  | Dh' eireadh Unionn moch's a mhaduinn: | Fingla would rise early |
							  | Rughadh Shuas's a'mhoch mhaduinn | With a rosy sky at dawn |
							  | Dheanadh Fionn an ath-chadal. | He would take another sleep. |
	- ## Major Cities
		- Scotland's two major cities have different reputations.
			- Glasgow is the third largest city in Britain.
				- It is associated with heavy industry and some of the worst housing conditions in Britain
					- (the district called the Gorbals, although now rebuilt, was famous in this respect).
				- However, this image is one-sided.
					- Glasgow has a strong artistic heritage.
					- At the turn of the last century the work of the Glasgow School put the city at the forefront of European design and architecture.
						- (led by Mackintosh)
					- In 1990, it was the European City of Culture.
					- Over the centuries,
						- Glasgow has received many immigrants from Ireland
						- in some ways it reflects the divisions in the community that exist in Northern Ireland.
							- For example, of its two rival football teams
								- one is Catholic
									- (Celtic)
								- the other is Protestant
									- (Rangers).
			- Edinburgh, which is half the size of Glasgow, has a comparatively middle-class image
				- (although class differences between the two cities are not really very great).
				- It is the capital of Scotland
					- associated with
						- scholarship
						- the law
						- administration.
				- This reputation, together with some features has led to its being called 'Athens of the North'
					- many fine historic buildings
					- and also perhaps topography
						- (there is a rock in the middle of the city on which stands the castle)
					-
				- The annual Edinburgh Festival of the arts is internationally famous.

- # Identity, Symbols and Customs
	- ## Scottish identity
		- People in Scotland have constant reminders of their distinctiveness.
			- First, several important aspects of public life are organized separately, and differently, from the rest of Britain
				- notably, education, law and religion.
			- Second, the Scottish way of speaking English is very distinctive.
				- A modern form of the dialect known as Scots is spoken in everyday life by most of the working classes in the lowlands.
					- It has many features which are different from other forms of English and cannot usually be understood by people who are not Scottish.
			- Third, there are many symbols of Scottishness which are well-known throughout Britain.
		- However, the feeling of being Scottish is not that simple.
			- This is partly because of the historical cultural split between highland and lowland Scotland.
				- A genuinely Scottish Gaelic sense of cultural identity is, in modern times, felt only by a few tens of thousands of people in some of the western isles of Scotland and the adjoining mainland.
					- These people speak Scottish Gaelic (which they call 'Gaelic") as a first language.
	- ## Family
		- Early families living in the Scottish Highlands were loyal to their clan
			- a unit that bound together relatives sharing a common ancestor or some other bond of loyalty.
			- However clans have less importance in the lives of individual family members today.
			- Each clan is still headed by a chieftain, but the position is mainly symbolic.
			- Contemporary members of a clan may make efforts to preserve its traditions and history.
			- Each clan is represented by a tartan, a distinctive plaid pattern.
		- In rural areas, the extended family can still be important, but in urban areas families tend to be small and generally close-knit
			- Although relatives visit each other often, families are independent from each other.
			- The elderly prefer to stay in their own homes and remain independent as long as possible, rather than live with their married children.
				- Just over half of all homes are owner occupied, the lowest level in the United Kingdom.
	- ## Food and drinks
		- Traditionally, the Scots have favoured wholesome meals
			- such as stews,
				- eaten with vegetables
					- such as neeps (turnips) and tatties (potatoes).
		- The national dish is haggis,
			- which is made from
				- ground sheep entrails
				- mixed with oats and spices
				- tied in a sheep's stomach and cooked.
			- Younger Scots typically eat less of this traditional fare.
		- The national drink is whiskey
			- (spelled "whisky" in Scotland),
			- The production of which contributes significantly to the economy.
			- There are more than 100 malt whisky distilleries in the Highlands
			- It is not surprising that the word 'Scotch' is used to mean whisky throughout the world.
	- ## Recreation
		- The most popular organized sport is soccer, followed by rugby, but a wide range of sports are enjoyed.
			- Many people play golf
				- which was devised in Scotland in the 14th or 15th century
				- the country has many excellent courses.
			- Scotland is also famous for its fishing.
			- Winter sports
				- include
					- curling
						- (in which two teams of four players slide granite "stones" over ice to reach a target)
					- skiing
						- Scotland is the only part of the United Kingdom where it is possible to ski,
							- although the snow conditions are not that reliable.
		- Highland Games are held in many parts of the Scottish Highlands during the summer.
			- They are a traditional kind of track and field meeting where the events include
				- tossing the caber
					- (a roughly trimmed tree trunk)
				- throwing the hammer
					- (a heavy metal ball attached to a chain)
				- participants often wear traditional dress
				- musicians play traditional bagpipe music.
		- Watching television and going to the cinema are also favorite leisure activities.
		- Pubs - public houses that serve alcoholic beverages
		- Sometimes food are probably the most popular venues outside the home for socializing.
	- ## Holidays and celebrations
		- New Year's Eve (Hopmanay) is when some of the year's most lively celebrations take place in Scotland
			- New Year's Eve is a more important festival in Scotland than it is in England, and it even has a special name.
			- It is not clear where the word '*hogmaynay*' comes from, but it is connected with the provision of food and drink for all visitors to your home on 31st December
			- Traditionally, on Hogmanay, children would go to the doors of their neighbours and sing and cry out "Hogmanay!" to receive oatmeal cakes in return
		- Another tradition associated with New Year's Eve is the first-footer
			- or the first person to cross the threshold of a home after midnight on New Year's Eve.
			- If the first-footer is a dark haired man carrying presents, the family should have good luck for the rest of the year.
		- The ancient song "Auld Lang Syne," which means "in memory of past times", first recorded on paper by beloved Scottish poet Robert Burns, is sung on New Year's Eve.
			- Auld lang syne
				- Should auld acquaintance be forgot
				- And never brought to mind
				- Should auld acquaintance be forgot
				- For the sake of auld lang syne
				- For auld lang syne, my dear
				- For auld lang syne
				- We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
				- For the sake of auld lang syne.
			- Many Scots honour Burns's birthday (25th January) by celebrating his life and works at Burns Suppers, where haggis is served.
		- Saint Andrew's Day, on 30th November, honours the patron saint of Scotland.
			- Some Scots wear a blue-and-white X on this day to symbolize the cross upon which Saint Andrew was crucified by the Romans.
			- This X-shaped cross has become a patriotic symbol.
		- There has been a recent revival in the popularity of wearing kilts on special occasions.
			- Men might wear them for events such as graduations, weddings, or Hogmanay.
	- ## Flowers of Scotland
		- The prickly purple thistle is perhaps the most identifiable symbols of all things Scottish and nowadays
			- it can be seen promoting the 'Scottishness of a wide variety of products, services and organisations.
			- Ever present in fields and pastures throughout Scotland, thistle has been Scotland's emblem for centuries.
				- The first use as a royal symbol was on silver coins issued by James III in 1470.
				- The plant, which grows to a height of five feet, has no enemies because of vicious spines that cover it like armor plating.
		- But why is it that such a proud people as the Scots should choose a humble weed as its national symbol?
			- In truth, no-one knows.
			- There is a legend which relates how a sleeping party of Scots warriors were almost set upon by an invading band of Vikings and were only saved when one of the attackers trod on a wild thistle with his bare feet.
			- His cries raised the alarm and the roused Scots duly defeated the Danes.
			- In gratitude, the plant became known as the Guardian Thistle and was adopted as the symbol of Scotland.
			- Sadly, there is no historical evidence to back up the tale.
		- Bluebells add a splash of colour as they display themselves in full flower in the woods in Scotland.
		- Here is an extract from a poem by someone who appreciated such delights.
			- The Bluebell of Scotland
				- The rose, summer's emblem, 'tis England's chosen tree
				- And France decks her shield with the stately Fluer-de-lis
				- But brighter, fairer far than these
				- There blooms a flower for me,
				- Tis the Bluebell, the Bluebell On Scotland's grassy lea
				- Where from the dark, up springs the lark
				- The rising sun to see!
