- # Physical Geography Of Wales
  collapsed:: true
	- ## Major cities
		- Wales is approximately 242 km (150 mi) from north to south.
		- About two-thirds of the total population of more than 3.1 million people live in the South Wales coastal area
			- where the three biggest towns are located:
				- Swansea
					- a city in southern Wales
					- a bustling seaport on the Tawe River
					- the seat of the University College of Swansea (1920)
					- host to an annual arts festival
					- an important industrial centre with manufactures that include steel and nonferrous metals and motor-vehicle parts.
					- A large petroleum refinery and chemical works are located in the suburb of Llandarcy.
					- A Norman fortress was erected on the site about 1099.
					- During the Middle Ages the community was a regional market center
					- Its industrial growth began in the 18th century
						- when the port was developed to export the coal mined in southern Wales
					- The town centre was destroyed by German bombing during World War II (1939-1945)
						- the city has since been rebuilt
					- Swansea was enlarged in 1974
						- now includes the scenic Gower Peninsula
							- a farming area
							- a resort area
				- Cardiff
					- the largest city of Wales
					- has been the official capital since 1955
					- There has been a community here for hundreds of years, but it began to grow quickly and to become prosperous during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
						- This was the period when the coal, iron and steel industries were developing in South Wales, and Cardiff became a major industrial town and an important port.
					- However, when these industries began to decline, Cardiff suffered too.
					- Today, the docks are much smaller, but the city is now expanding as a commercial and administrative centre.
					- It is an attractive and interesting place to live in
						- with good communications
						- plenty of parks and a varied population
							- 25% of which are university and college students.
					- As a tourist, you might want to visit
						- the castle Llandaff cathedral
						- the National Museum of Wales
						- If you like music, there is
							- the famous national concert hall, St David's Hall
							- the New Theatre, which is the home of the Welsh National Opera Company.
				- Newport
					- is a port city on the Usk River.
					- is both a major steel-producing centre of the United Kingdom and a vital commercial and transportation hub for southeastern Wales.
					- Its port, improved in the 1970s, handles imports of ore and timber and exports of iron, steel, and machinery.
					- Located here is
						- Saint Woolos's Cathedral
						- a notable museum
						- art gallery
		- Most of the rest of Wales is mountainous.
			- Because of this, communication between north and south used to be difficult.
			- As a result, each part of Wales has closer contact with its neighbouring part of England than it does with other parts of Wales
				- the north with Liverpool
				- mid-Wales with the English west midlands.
			- The area round Mount Snowdon in the north-west of the country is very beautiful and is the largest National Park in Britain.
			- The highest peak, Snowdon, is 1,085 m.
				- You can reach the summit on foot or by the mountain railway, which is 7 km long.
	- ## Weather and climate
		- The climate of Wales, like that of England
			- is mild and moist.
		- The average daily temperature
			- in July is 16°C
			- in January it is 4°C.
		- Of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom, Wales has the highest average rainfall (about 1385mm for the whole country).
			- Annual rainfall varies with elevation
				- ranging from about 760mm in certain coastal regions
				- to more than 2,500mm in the Snowdon massif.
- # Identity, Symbols And Customs
	- ## Welsh identity
		- A feeling of loyalty to Wales is often similar in nature to the fairly weak loyalties to particular geographical areas found throughout England - it is regional rather than nationalistic.
			- People of Wales do not have as many reminders of their Welshness in everyday life.
				- The organization of public life is similar to that in England.
				- Nor are there as many well-known symbols of Welshness.
			- In addition, a large minority of the people in Wales probably do not consider themselves to be especially Welsh at all.
				- In the 19th century large numbers of Scottish, Irish, and English people went to find work there
				- Today many English people still make their homes in Wales or have a holiday house there.
		- However, there is one single highly important symbol of Welsh identity: the Welsh language.
			- According to the Welsh Language Use Survey 2019-20, 22% of the population aged three or older could speak Welsh[^1].
				- For these people, Welsh identity obviously means more than just living in the region known as Wales.
			- Moreover, in comparison to the other small minority languages of Europe, Welsh show signs of continued vitality.
			- Thanks to successive campaigns, the language receives a lot of public support.
				- All children in Wales learn it at school
				- There are many local newspapers in Welsh, there is a Welsh television channel and nearly all public notices and signs are written in both Welsh and English.
	- ## The Welsh language
	  id:: 65dd1c81-6c9a-4fca-bd7e-8ce6f548820c

					- This is the Welsh name for a competition people meet to dance, sing and read poems.
						- Usually, only Welsh is spoken and in recent years they have attracted people who wish to protest against the influence of English on Wales language and culture.
	- ## Customs of Wales
		- Somewhat isolated by a rugged, mountainous terrain, the Welsh have retained more of the culture of their Celtic forebears than have either the Scots or the English.
		- The Welsh are well known for their love of singing, and their hymns and folk songs are widely known throughout the world.

			- the national music
			- literary festival

			- It has been known for members of the audience to remain at the Esteddfod from 11am until the final male voice competition at 10.30pm,
				- when the day usually ends with thousands more people out on the promenade than in the pavilion
			- Many of the present-day Welsh singing stars started on their careers at the Miners Eisteddfod,
				- it is a launching pad for elocutionists and soloists
				- one of the highlights of the day's events is the children's choir competition
					- which attracts the finest juvenile choirs trom mining villages.
				- It is always the wish of the organizers to make the proceedings as entertaining as possible by providing competitions for as many classes as possible
					- women's choirs
					- men's glee parties
					- mixed choirs
					- the male voice choirs
						- which attract some of the finest choirs in the land.
	- ## Welsh symbols: The Daffodil an the Leek
		- The national flower of Wales is the daffoil
			- which is traditionally worn on St. David's Day.
		- The vegetable called leek is also considered to be a traditional emblem of Wales.
