	- ## Renewable Energy Technologies
		- 2. Read the following passage about renewable energy technologies and answer the questions
			- Energy is one of the essential needs of a functioning society. The scale of its use is closely associated with its capabilities and the quality of life that its members experience. The quality of life enjoyed by the developed nations today is due in large part to the availability of plentiful and affordable fossil fuels over the last century. Energy is an integral part of global commerce and its use has expanded rapidly as both population and per capita consumption have grown. Concerns about the sustainability of present energy-use practices are now arising in several areas: the rapid depletion of nonrenewable resources, the impacts of emissions on the global environment, and global instabilities that affect the security of supplies.
			- Solving the energy crisis is one of the most essential undertakings of the 21st century. Perfect solutions will be hard to come by, due not only to drastic differences in political and public support for alternative energy throughout the world, but the extensive knowledge required to address the many challenges associated with the global energy landscape. Alternative energy sources are being pursued for a variety of reasons. Many countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol, making measures to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases a top priority in today's culture. Alternative, or renewable, energy sources hold a lot of promise for reducing the quantity of pollutants produced as a result of energy use. Alternative energy not only protects against unwanted by-products, but it also helps to maintain many of the natural resources that we now utilise as energy sources. It's crucial to know what sorts of alternative energy are available in order to comprehend how they can assist protect the planet's delicate ecological balance and conserve non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels.
			- Alternative energy sources are constantly replaced, non-polluting resources. They are not caused by fossil fuel combustion or atom splitting. Utilisation of renewable energy helps supplement our energy supply. Alternative energy sources include biomass energy, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power, solar power, wind power, fuel cells, ocean thermal energy conversion, tidal energy, and wave energy. Biomass is a type of renewable energy derived from organic matter. Wood, forest and mill leftovers, animal waste, cereals, agricultural crops, and aquatic plants are all examples of biomass fuels. These materials are used as fuel to heat water for steam generation or are processed into liquids and gases that can be burned to achieve the same result. By 2020, the United States could generate up to four- and-a-half times more biopower thanks to increased biomass use, cheaper production costs, and improved technology. It is predicted that biomass would grow at the fastest rate among renewable energy sources, increasing by 80 percent to 65.7 billion KW by 2020.
			- Geothermal energy extracts heat from the earth's interior. To deliver the hot water or steam to the surface, wells are bored into geothermal reservoirs. In geothermal facilities, the steam drives a turbine- generator, which generates energy. This heat is used to heat homes and greenhouses in some regions, as well as to supply processed heat for businesses and industries. Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, is heated by geothermal energy. The majority of geothermal resources are found in the western United States. Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes by tapping into shallow earth energy, and they may be used practically anyplace. Much more power could be generated from hydrothermal resources with technical advancements. Scientists have been experimenting with geothermal power plants by pumping water into the hot, dry rock 3-6 miles beneath the earth's surface.
			- Hydroelectric (hydropower) energy is produced by driving turbine-generators with the force of falling water. Hydroelectricity generates more electricity than any other renewable energy source. Estimates indicate that hydroelectric power in the United States will decrease from 389 billion KW in 1999 to 298 billion KW in 2020. The majority of the best hydropower sites have already been developed, and there are concerns about the environmental impact of large-scale hydroelectric installations, therefore this decline is anticipated.
			- Solar power is produced without the use of a turbine or an electromagnet. Photovoltaic cells on special panels catch sunlight and convert it directly into electricity. A battery is used to store the electricity. Solar energy can also be utilised to heat domestic water directly (solar thermal technology). The domestic photovoltaic (PV) industry might supply up to 15% of the new peak electricity capacity required in the United States by 2020.
			  Electricity can be generated using wind energy. The blades of a windmill spin when wind blows past them. The shaft connected to the blades rotates, powering a pump or turning a generator to generate electricity. After that, electricity is stored in batteries. The amount of energy that can be produced is determined by the wind speed and the size of the blades. In windier areas of the country, wind energy is more efficient. The majority of wind energy is generated by wind farms, which are enormous clusters of turbines positioned in reliably windy areas. Wind as a source of energy is both free and non- polluting with no emissions or chemical waste. Wind-generated electricity is becoming more prevalent.
			- Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that use a chemical reaction to generate power. Fuel cells are rechargeable, have no moving parts, are quiet, and have no moving parts. Scientists are investigating how they could be utilised as a power source for almost-emission-free autos and as electricity generating plants. The exorbitant cost of producing fuel cells has kept this important energy source from becoming widely used.
			- Ocean sources; Oceans, which span more than 70% of the earth's surface, contain both thermal and mechanical energy from the sun's heat and tides and waves. Solar radiation is converted to electricity by ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). To create electricity, OTEC power plants employ the temperature difference between warm surface waters heated by the sun and colder waters found at ocean depths. The energy of the tides can also be used to generate electricity. The power of changing tides is harnessed via tidal energy, but considerable tidal variances are required. The tidal process makes use of the tides' natural motion to fill reservoirs, which are then progressively emptied through
