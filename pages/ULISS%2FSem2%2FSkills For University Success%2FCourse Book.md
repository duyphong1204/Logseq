- *mình tranh thủ dữ liệu hóa đống kiến thức này và coi như một cách học, thì chắc nhớ được vẫn cần phải đọc nhớ một cách chủ động, mà tạm thời chép ra thì chỉ ôn lại một cách từ tốn và xem có gì bỏ sót hay chưa hiểu không thôi*
- {{cloze để viết nhanh ta nên làm gì, nhfin tập trung vào sách, vào màn hình, vào bàn phím, hay chủ động hướng tay ta đến đâu đó chứ không để kệ nó như thường - nhìn đâu cũng được nhưng tưởng tượng trong đầu tay nên đi ra phím nào là đủ, hoặc đọc sách xong nhớ liếc lên nhìn màn hình, tất nhiên cũng phải nghĩ học nữa}}
- {{cloze cái nào quan trọng thì highlight để nó nổi lên, cũng là thứ cần nhớ ngắn gọn, càng ở các lùi dòng sau thì càng không cần nhớ, đọc lướt hoặc cần thì mới tra hoặc tự suy là đủ}}
