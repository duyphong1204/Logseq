			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ---
			- Potable water: freshwater cleaned with chemicals, such as chlorine or ozone, to kill bacteria and make it safe for drinking
			- Saline water: water, such as seawater, containing very heavy concentrations of dissolved salts (usually over 5,000 mg/l)
			- Brackish water: water that contains more salt than freshwater, but less than seawater, occurs naturally where freshwater and seawater meet, such as river estuaries, mangrove, swamps, and some inland lakes and seas
			- Fresh water: water from either a surface or ground source, normally containing less than 1% salt; around 70% of this type of water exists as ice caps and glaciers
			- Surface water: water that collects above the ground in streams, rivers, natural lakes, wetlands, seas, oceans and reservoirs
			- Waste water: water that is contaminated from domestic or industrial use and cannot be reused unless treated and purified
			- Desalinated water: water from any process that removes excess salt and other minerals to make it suitable for drinking, irrigation or certain industrial processes
			- Ground water: water from rain, snow, flooding, etc..., that soaks into the Earth's surface, forming underground streams and aquifers (which supply water for wells)
			- Distilled water: Water heated to boiling point, vaporized, cooled and then condensed in order to remove impurities; commonly used in automotive cooling systems and batteries; can also be used as drinking water
		- ### B. Match words in the left and right columns to make seven compounds
