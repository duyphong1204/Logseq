	- The United States of America
	  collapsed:: true
		- is a federal republic of 50 states.
			- there are 48 conterminous states
				- which extend from latitude 25°N to 50°N and longitude 125"W to 67°W
				- (4,500km and four time zones from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast)
			- the other two states, Hawaii and Alaska
				- are situated respectively in the tropical part of the Pacific Ocean
					- (16°W. 3,200km from the mainland) and near the Arctic circle.
		- The 50 states form an area of 9,372,610 sq km
			- (31 times the size of Italy)
			- making the United States the third largest country in the world.
	- ## Topography
	  collapsed:: true
		- The country naturally presents a tremendous variety in physical features (and climate).
		  collapsed:: true
			- moist rainforest
			- arid desert
			- bald mountain peaks.
		- Mount Denali
		  collapsed:: true
			- (formerly known as Mount McKinley)
			- in Alaska at 6,194m
			- is the highest point in the United States,
		- part of Death Valley in California is 86m below sea level.
		- The eastern coast of the United States
		  collapsed:: true
			- is a long, gently rolling lowland area known as the coastal plains.
			- These coastal plains, which stretch from Maine to Texas, are very flat (nowhere in Florida is more than 106m above sea level, for example) and often swampy.
			- In general the soil is very poor, except in the fertile southern part, where the plain reaches many miles inland
				- (the Cotton Belt of the Old South and the citrus country of central Florida).
			- The Appalachian Mountains
				- at the western edge of the Atlantic coastal plain
				- a chain of low, almost unbroken mountains
				- stretching from the northern part of Maine south-west into Alabama
				- These mountains contain enormous quantities of easily accessible coal and iron
					- (which helps explain the huge concentration of heavy industry along the lower region of the Great Lakes)
			- The Piedmont hills
				- to the east of the main peaks
				- are the most highly productive agricultural land in the country after the Midwest.
		- The heart of the United States
			- is a vast plain
			- broken by
			  collapsed:: true
				- the Superior Upland and Black Hills in the north
				- the Ozark Plateau in the south
					- which extends from central Canada southwards to Mexico
					- from the Appalachian Mountains westwards to the Cordillera.
			- These interior plains
				- which rise gradually like a saucer to higher land on all sides
				- are divided into two major parts:
					- the wetter, eastern portion is called the Central Plains
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the western portion the Great Plains
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
						- is the Cordileras
							- which include
								- the Rocky Mountains
								- the ranges of Great Basin
								- the Sierra Nevada
								- the Coast Ranges.
							- The western edge of the Cordillera
								- is characterized by a coastal chain of high mountains
									- among which there are broad fertile valleys.
								- The most important ranges
									- the Sierra Nevada
									- the Cascades in the eastern part
									- the Coastal Ranges along the western coast.
								- There is no Pacific coastal plain
								- between these two sets of mountains
									- there is a large plateau region
									- with
										- steep cliffs
										- canyons
										- basins
											- many basins are rich in resources
												- such as
													- oil
													- natural gas.
										- isolated ranges
						- On its eastern edge
							- the Rocky Mountains
								- a high, discontinuous chain of mountains
								- stretching from mountainous Alaska down to Mexico
								- rise sharply from the Great Plains
								- These rugged mountains contain many important metals
									- such as
										- lead
										- uranium
										- gold
					- both of which have good soil.
		- Hawaii is a chain of twenty islands
			- only seven of which are inhabited.
			- The mountainous islands were formed by volcanic activity and there are still a number of active volcanoes.
		- The United States has several immense long rivers.
			- There are a large number of rivers in the eastern part of the nation
			- the longest river
				- the Missouri (3,942km)
					- a tributary of the Mississippi (3,760km)
			- the Mississippi-Missouri-Red Rock system extends for 6,176 km before entering the Gulf of Mexico near New Orleans.
			- Two other tributaries of the Mississippi
				- the Ohio
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- the Tennessee
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- are more than 1,250km long.
			- In the West
				- the Rio Grande
					- forms part of the United States-Mexico border.
					- flows for 3,016km
					- the only river systems reach the Pacific
						- Colorado (2.320km)
						- Columbia (2.240km)
						- the San Joaquim-Sacramento
	- ## Weather and climate
	  collapsed:: true
		- Virtually every type of climate can be found somewhere in the United States
			- from arctic in Alaska
			- to subtropical in Florida
		- The climate is not generally temperate
			- despite the latitude
			- as the tremendous size of the North America landmass heightens the extreme variations in temperature and precipitation
				- especially in the central regions
					- in Dakota temperatures have reached a maximum of 49°C and a minimum of -60°C
		- Most of the country has a humid continental climate
			- with hot summers and cold winters
			- while the lack of natural barriers either to north or the south allows cold, dry air to flow south from Canada
			- warm, humid air north from the Gulf of Mexico giving rise to spectacular weather of every possible type in the Great Plains and Midwest.
		- Summers are hot and very humid in this region and rainfall decreases to the west as a result of the rain shadow created by the West Pacific range and Sierra Nevada.
		- The southwest portion of the Great Plains is the hottest and most arid region of the United States
			- with precipitation, mostly in the form of summer showers, averaging less than 250mm a year.
		- The Pacific coast is almost rainless in the summer
			- although there is often fog.
			- In the winter there is frequent drizzle, but the climate remains generally warm and dry. especially in California.
			- The eastern part of the country
				- is moderately rainy
				- with precipitation fairly well distributed throughout the year.
				- Summers tend to be extremely humid, especially along the coast of Texas and Florida.
		- The USA is subject to a range of climate-related calamities
			- such as hurricanes in the Southeast
			- tornadoes on the Plains
			- flooding around the main rivers
			- severe snowstorms in the mountains and northern plains
			- forest fires in the West and California.
	- ## Geographic diversity
	- Durring the settlement of the nation
		- immigrants moved westward across the United States and found a rich and varied natural environment
		- From the original coastal colonies, setllers made their way over the Appalachian Mountains beginning in the 1700s.
		- Beyond Berfers made the the strolling teritory drained by the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. There settlers encountered the rich farmlands of the Ohio Valley, the Mississippi Delta, and the Great Plains. For decades, the rugged peaks of the Rocky Mountains and he and landscape of the Southwest discouraged movement further west. In the mid. 1800s, however, spurred by the discovery of gold in California, determined settlers followed trails through the mountain passes to reach the West Coast. In the valleys of California and Oregon, they found productive agricultural land, and they began harvesting the timber reserves from the untouched forests of the Pacific Northwest. The purchase of Alaska in 1967 added a mountainous northern territory rich in natural resources. The annexation of Hawaii in 1898 gave the United States what would be its only tropical state. The United States has been blessed with many natural advantages, such as climates favorable for agriculture, extensive internal waterways, and abundant natural resources.

		  Another major natural advantage-one that is taken for granted by most Americans-is that the major river systems (the Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Colorado, and Rio Grande systems) flow south. If these rivers flowed north, as rivers do in Russian Siberia, ice and frozen soil would block the melt water, causing floods that would saturate the land and render it unusable for agriculture. Instead, when spring thaws arrive in the interior mountains of the United States, melt water flows unimpeded through the river systems to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California. This almost uninterrupted flow of water provides ample supplies for drinking water and for crop irrigation and industrial production.
		  
		  The United States has many other natural advantages. A wide array of valuable mineral resources, such as oil, natural gas, iron ore, coal, lead, zinc, phosphate, silver, and copper, benefits mining and industry. The shallow waters along the coastline, known as the continental shelf, serve as a rich breeding ground for marine life, which promotes commercial and sport fishing. The comprehensive network of rivers also provides transportation routes for bulk cargo and the potential for the development of
