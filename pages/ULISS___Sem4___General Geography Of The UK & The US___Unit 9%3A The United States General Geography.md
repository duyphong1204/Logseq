- Physical Geography of The US
- The United States of America is a federal republic of 50 states. There are 48 conterminous states which extend from latitude 25째N to 50째N and longitude 125"W to 67째W (4,500km and four time zones from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast); the other two states, Hawaii and Alaska, are situated respectively in the tropical part of the Pacific Ocean (16째W. 3,200km from the mainland) and near the Arctic circle. The 50 states form an area of 9,372,610 sq km (31 times the size of Italy), making the United States the third largest country in the world.
- Topography
- The country naturally presents a tremendous variety in physical features (and climate). ranging from moist rainforest to arid desert and bald mountain peaks. Mount Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley) in Alaska at 6,194m is the highest point in the United States, while part of Death Valley in California is 86m below sea level. The eastern coast of the United States is a long, gently rolling lowland area known as the coastal plains. These coastal plains, which stretch from Maine to Texas, are very flat (nowhere in Florida is more than 106m above sea level, for example) and often swampy. In general the soil is very poor, except in the fertile southern part, where the plain reaches many miles inland (the Cotton Belt of the Old South and the citrus country of central Florida).
- At the western edge of the Atlantic coastal plain there is a chain of low, almost unbroken mountains, stretching from the northern part of Maine south-west into Alabama, called the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains contain enormous quantities of easily accessible coal and iron (which helps explain the huge concentration of heavy industry along the lower region of the Great Lakes). The Piedmont hills, to the east of the main peaks, are the most highly productive agricultural land in the country after the Midwest.
