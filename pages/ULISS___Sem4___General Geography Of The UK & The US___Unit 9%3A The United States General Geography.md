- # Physical Geography of The US
	- The United States of America
	  collapsed:: true
		- is a federal republic of 50 states.
			- there are 48 conterminous states
				- which extend from latitude 25째N to 50째N and longitude 125"W to 67째W
				- (4,500km and four time zones from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast)
			- the other two states, Hawaii and Alaska
				- are situated respectively in the tropical part of the Pacific Ocean
					- (16째W. 3,200km from the mainland) and near the Arctic circle.
		- The 50 states form an area of 9,372,610 sq km
			- (31 times the size of Italy)
			- making the United States the third largest country in the world.
	- ## Topography
		- The country naturally presents a tremendous variety in physical features (and climate).
		  collapsed:: true
			- moist rainforest
			- arid desert
			- bald mountain peaks.
		- Mount Denali
		  collapsed:: true
			- (formerly known as Mount McKinley)
			- in Alaska at 6,194m
			- is the highest point in the United States,
		- part of Death Valley in California is 86m below sea level.
		- The eastern coast of the United States
		  collapsed:: true
			- is a long, gently rolling lowland area known as the coastal plains.
			- These coastal plains, which stretch from Maine to Texas, are very flat (nowhere in Florida is more than 106m above sea level, for example) and often swampy.
			- In general the soil is very poor, except in the fertile southern part, where the plain reaches many miles inland
				- (the Cotton Belt of the Old South and the citrus country of central Florida).
			- The Appalachian Mountains
				- at the western edge of the Atlantic coastal plain
				- a chain of low, almost unbroken mountains
				- stretching from the northern part of Maine south-west into Alabama
				- These mountains contain enormous quantities of easily accessible coal and iron
					- (which helps explain the huge concentration of heavy industry along the lower region of the Great Lakes)
			- The Piedmont hills
				- to the east of the main peaks
				- are the most highly productive agricultural land in the country after the Midwest.
		- The heart of the United States
			- is a vast plain
			- broken by
			  collapsed:: true
				- the Superior Upland and Black Hills in the north
				- the Ozark Plateau in the south
					- which extends from central Canada southwards to Mexico
					- from the Appalachian Mountains westwards to the Cordillera.
			- These interior plains
				- which rise gradually like a saucer to higher land on all sides
				- are divided into two major parts:
					- the wetter, eastern portion is called the Central Plains
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the western portion the Great Plains
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
						- is the Cordileras
							- which include
								- the Rocky Mountains
								- the ranges of Great Basin
								- the Sierra Nevada
								- the Coast Ranges.
							- The western edge of the Cordillera
								- is characterized by a coastal chain of high mountains
									- among which there are broad fertile valleys.
								- The most important ranges
									- the Sierra Nevada
									- the Cascades in the eastern part
									- the Coastal Ranges along the western coast.
								- There is no Pacific coastal plain
								- between these two sets of mountains
									- there is a large plateau region
									- with
										- steep cliffs
										- canyons
										- basins
											- many basins are rich in resources
												- such as
													- oil
													- natural gas.
										- isolated ranges
						- On its eastern edge
							- the Rocky Mountains
								- a high, discontinuous chain of mountains
								- stretching from mountainous Alaska down to Mexico
								- rise sharply from the Great Plains
								- These rugged mountains contain many important metals
									- such as
										- lead
										- uranium
										- gold
					- both of which have good soil.
		- Hawaii is a chain of twenty islands
			- only seven of which are inhabited.
			- The mountainous islands were formed by volcanic activity and there are still a number of active volcanoes.
		- The United States has several immense long rivers.
			- There are a large number of rivers in the eastern part of the nation
			- the longest river
				- the Missouri (3,942km)
					- a tributary of the Mississippi (3,760km)
			- the Mississippi-Missouri-Red Rock system extends for 6,176 km before entering the Gulf of Mexico near New Orleans.
			- Two other tributaries of the Mississippi
				- the Ohio
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- the Tennessee
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- are more than 1,250km long.
			- In the West
				- the Rio Grande
					- forms part of the United States-Mexico border.
					- flows for 3,016km
					- the only river systems reach the Pacific
						- Colorado (2.320km)
						- Columbia (2.240km)
						- the San Joaquim-Sacramento
