  Chapter preview
  This chapter begins with a discussion of some of the differences between writing and 
  speech, including what each medium can and cannot express. It then examines the 
  production of human speech sounds. The criteria for analyzing consonant sounds 
  are explained. An inventory of the consonant sounds in English and explication of 
  the method of their phonetic transcription follows. Vowels sounds are next classified, 
  with a description of which vowel sounds English has and how they are transcribed. 
  The chapter ends with discussion of formal versus functional means of distinguishing 
  vowels and consonants.
  Commentary
  As defined in Chapter 1, phonetics is the study of speech sounds in general. It has three 
  subdivisions:
  1. the study of how sounds are made or the mechanics of their production by human 
  beings (“articulatory phonetics”);
  2. the study of how sounds are heard or the mechanics of their perception (“auditory 
  phonetics”); and
  3. the study of the physical properties of the speech waves which constitute speech sound 
  (“acoustic phonetics”).
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 17
  In this chapter, after briefly examining how speech sounds are made, we will turn to phonology, the study of the speech sounds in a particular language, in our case, the inventory 
  of sounds constituting the sound system of English, including consonants, vowels, and 
  glides. Our study of English phonology will continue in the next chapter with a consideration of the distinctive and nondistinctive sounds in English as well as of sound combinations and syllable structure in the language.
  1. The spoken versus the written form of language
  The initial step in the study of the sound system of a language is to distinguish between 
  speech and writing. This is often a difficult distinction for literate people to make since we are 
  tempted to consider the written form as equivalent to language. But speech and writing are, 
  in fact, two quite distinct media of language. Speech is temporally prior, both in the history 
  of humankind and in the history of the individual. Languages existed for millennia before 
  writing systems were invented. We learn to speak effortlessly, but must struggle to learn to 
  write; many, in fact, do not learn to write yet are fluent speakers of the language. It is salutary 
  to remember that even in Shakespeare’s day the majority of English speakers were illiterate, 
  yet verbally proficient enough to understand Shakespeare’s word plays. Some languages have 
  no written form, but all languages have spoken forms. Moreover, a variety of writing systems 
  are used to record the languages of the world, some languages have more than one writing 
  system, and even very closely-related languages may use very different writing systems.
  1.1 English spelling
  That writing is often an imperfect means of representing speech is perhaps most obvious 
  in the well-known inadequacies of English spelling. If we compare the actual sounds of 
  English with the orthography, the graphic symbols or letters used in writing, we find the 
  following discrepancies:
  – one sound can be represented by a variety of graphemes (alphabet letters), as with 
  the vowel sound in meat, meet, machine, city, key, ceiling, people, niece, evil, Caesar, 
  amoeba, and quay;
  – one grapheme can represent a variety of sounds, as with d in damage, educate, picked;
  – one or more graphemes may represent no sound at all, as in knee, gnat, lamb, receipt, 
  right, honor, rhyme, psalm, and salmon;
  – two or more graphemes may represent a single sound, as in throne, chain, edge, shore, 
  nation, itch, inn, school, eat, friend, too, leopard, cause, blood, or lieutenant;
  – a grapheme may simply indicate the quality of a neighboring sound, as in dinner vs. diner
  (where a double or single n indicates the quality of the preceding vowel) or dine vs. din
  (where the presence or absence of final e indicates the quality of the preceding vowel);
  18 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  – a single grapheme may represent two or more sounds, as in box, where the letter x
  represents the sound sequence “ks”; and
  – some sounds have no graphic representation, as with the initial sounds in universe
  and one.
  Self-Testing Exercise 2.1: Examining the reasons for the marked incongruity between sound 
  and spelling in English makes for a fascinating historical study. Read the brief discussion and 
  do the self-testing exercise on the website.
  For the study of speech sounds, therefore, orthographic systems are clearly inadequate. 
  We need a system of recording sounds in which a single written symbol represents one 
  and only one speech sound and in which a single sound is represented by one and only one 
  written symbol. For this reason, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) was invented in 
  1888 (and revised in 1989). It is based on the Roman alphabet primarily, with some symbols 
  from other writing systems, as well as some invented symbols and diacritics (marks added 
  to symbols). The recording of the sounds of a language in the IPA is called “transcription”. 
  Much of this chapter will be concerned with the transcription of English using the IPA.
  1.2 The advantages of speech and writing
  It is important to keep in mind, however, that each medium of language – speech and 
  writing – fulfills different functions and has certain advantages. On one hand, the oral 
  medium expresses certain meaning features that cannot always be recorded in the 
  written medium:
  1. emphasis: indicated by syllable stress in speech and very inexactly by underlining in 
  writing, as in I want thát one, not thís one;
  2. sentence type: indicated by intonation (the rising and falling contours of the voice) in 
  speech and very crudely by end punctuation in writing, as in the difference between 
  He said he would help. and He said he would help? (though often different word orders 
  distinguish different sentence types such as questions or commands);
  3. homographs: words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently, for 
  example, sewer ‘one who sews’/‘a conduit for sewage’ or hót dòg ‘a sausage’/hót dóg ‘an 
  overheated canine’;
  4. paralanguage: tones of voice and vocal qualifiers, indicated by shouting, growling, whispering, drawling, and so on;
  5. variations in pronunciation resulting from dialect or idiolect (an individual’s unique 
  dialect);
  6. kinesics: indicated by body movement, facial expressions, and gestures;
  7. performance errors, slips, or hesitations; and
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 19
  8. features of the speech situation, such as the relation of the speaker and the hearer or 
  intimacy and personal contact.
  In reading over the above list, you might have thought of dialogue in novels or plays as an 
  exception. However, dialogue is always very stylized and conventionalized. For example, 
  tones of voice, kinesics, contextual features, and many performance errors must be explicitly described. If dialogue were faithfully to represent the performance errors of real conversation, it would be nearly incomprehensible; the transcribed conversation would be 
  quite incoherent. Features of regional or social dialect are also imperfectly represented 
  (as in the use of unconventional spelling Ah’m tahrd for a Southern US pronunciation 
  of I’m tired or the use of spellings which approximate the actual pronunciation of words 
  such as bekuz, nite, wuz, and sez (for the conventionalized spellings because, night, was, 
  and says).
  On the other hand, there are aspects of language which writing expresses but 
  speech cannot:
  1. historical changes: older pronunciations preserved in the spelling, such as comb, gnat, 
  or taught;
  2. words: indicated by spaces, sometimes disambiguating ambiguous phonological 
  sequences such as nitrate/night rate, syntax/sin tax, or homemade/home aid;
  3. homophones: words which are pronounced the same but spelled differently, such as 
  bear/bare, meat/meet, or maid/made;
  4. related words or affixes which sound different, such as photograph, photography, photographic or the past tense affix -ed in rated, walked, robbed;
  5. a greater range of vocabulary, more complex syntax, and greater refinement of style, 
  resulting in part from the planning permitted by the situation of writing;
  6. language free of performance errors (which, in fact, we often are not consciously aware 
  of in the spoken form);
  7. a standard language without dialectal differences, allowing easier communication 
  among diverse groups;
  8. permanency: permitting the keeping of historical annals, the recording of laws, and 
  the writing of other permanent records.
  Incidentally, it is because of points (1) and (7) above that the many attempts at spelling 
  reform in the history of the English language have been unsuccessful. For example, we will 
  see below that certain modern dialects of English do not pronounce the “r” in words such 
  as part or par, while others do. Such instances of dialectal variation in pronunciation seriously impede decisions about standardizing English spelling: If English spelling were to 
  represent pronunciation more closely, which dialect’s pronunciation should become fixed 
  in its orthography?
  20 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  2. The production of speech sounds
  Keeping in mind the primacy of speech, we will now consider how we make speech sounds. 
  Speech sounds are produced using, but modifying, the respiratory system. When speaking, the number of breaths per minute increases. The intake of air (inspiration) becomes 
  shorter while the period of exhalation (expiration) increases. A greater amount of air is 
  expelled, with a gradual decrease in the volume of air and fairly constant pressure. Importantly for the production of sound, the air is often blocked or impeded at some point or 
  points on its way out.
  English and most languages of the world use the egressive pulmonic system to generate speech sounds. The term “egressive” refers to the fact that sound is produced when air 
  is exiting, not entering, the lungs. “Pulmonic” refers to the use of the lungs as the power 
  source. In speaking, air is expelled from the lungs by a downward movement of the ribs and 
  upward movement of the diaphragm. The air travels up the bronchial tubes to the trachea, 
  or “wind pipe”, and through the larynx, or “Adam’s apple”. The larynx contains a valve which 
  functions to close off the trachea while you are eating. This valve has been adapted for the 
  purposes of speech; it is known as the vocal cords. The vocal cords are two muscles stretching 
  horizontally across the larynx, attached to cartilage at either end that controls their movement. The vocal cords are relatively open during normal breathing, but closed during eating. 
  The space between the cords when they are open is known as the glottis. The vocal cords of 
  men and of women are of different lengths: 1.7 cm for women, 2.3 for men. This, as we will 
  see later, accounts in part for the different vocal qualities of men and women. Air continues 
  past the larynx into the pharynx, whose only real function is as a connector and resonator.
  The air then moves into the vocal tract (see Figure 2.1), consisting of the oral and 
  nasal cavities. The oral cavity, that is, the mouth, is a resonator and a generator of speech 
  sounds via the articulators, which may be active (moving) or passive (stationary). The 
  active articulators include the following:
  – the tongue, divided into (1) the front (consisting of the tip or “apex” and the blade or 
  “lamina”), (2) the back (or “dorsum”), and (3) the root: the tongue modifies the shape 
  of the cavity, acts as a valve by touching parts of the mouth to stop the flow of air, and 
  is shaped in various ways to direct the flow of air.
  – the lower lip: the lip may be placed against the upper teeth or, together with the upper 
  lip, may be closed or opened, rounded or spread.
  The passive articulators include the following:
  – the teeth, both upper and lower.
  – the roof of the mouth, which is divided into (1) the alveolar ridge, which is 1 cm 
  behind the upper teeth, (2) the hard palate, which is the domed, bony plate, (3) the 
  soft palate, or velum, which is the muscular flap at the rear, and (4) the uvula, which 
  is the tip of the velum.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 21
  – the pharynx, or back of the throat, which is used by some languages (but not English) 
  in producing speech sounds.
  HINT: If you run your tongue back along the top of your mouth from your teeth, you 
  should be able to feel your alveolar ridge just behind the upper teeth and to distinguish 
  your palate from your velum. As your tongue travels backwards towards the velum, you 
  should feel the membrane covering the roof of the mouth become softer.

  Figure 2.1. The Vocal Tract with (a) Velum Raised and (b) Velum Lowered
  A useful feature of the velum is that it is movable. If it is raised against the back of the pharynx (called “velic closure”) blocking the entrance to the nasal passageway, then air passes 
  out only through the oral cavity (see Figure 2.1a). The result is known as an oral sound. If 
  the velum is lowered (called “velic opening”), then air can pass out through the other cavity, 
  the nasal cavity, that is the nose (see Figure 2.1b). If air passes out of the nose exclusively, a 
  nasal sound is produced, but if air passes out of both the nose and the mouth, a nasalized 
  sound is produced. People who have a “nasal quality” to their voice probably have incomplete closure of the velum at all times, so that a little air is always able to escape through the 
  nose. Also, when you have a cold and your velum is swollen, you will have imperfect velic 
  closure and hence a nasal voice; you will also not be able to produce exclusively nasal sounds 
  since your nose is blocked and will substitute oral sounds (e.g. the sound “b” for “m”).
  Let us return, briefly, to the larynx and the vocal cords to see how they function in 
  producing sounds. When the cords are widely separated and fairly taut, no noise is produced. This is known as an “open glottis” and produces a voiceless sound (see Figure 2.2a). 
  However, the vocal cords may also be set in vibration (“phonation”), and this produces a 
  voiced sound (see Figure 2.2b). They vibrate open and shut as air passes through. Vibration is 
  begun by initially closing the vocal cords completely, but with the cords fairly relaxed. Air 
  pressure builds up below the cords and blows them apart. Then the pressure decreases and 
  22 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  the cords close again; these events occur in rapid succession. Women’s vocal cords, being 
  smaller, vibrate more rapidly, normally 190–250 Hz (times/second), while men’s larger 
  vocal cords vibrate 100–150 Hz. When the vocal cords are vibrating, you can feel a vibration and hear a buzzing.
  HINT: To feel the vibration, place your fingers on your larynx or cup your hands over your 
  ears and say sa-za-sa-za. You should sense the vibration of the cords with the “z” sound 
  but not the “s” sound.
  A “closed glottis” occurs when the vocal cords are brought completely together once and 
  the air stream is interrupted. This produces a speech sound we will consider later called a 
  “glottal stop”.1
  Whispering involves bringing the vocal cords close together, keeping them fairly taut 
  but not vibrating them. Air is restricted through a small triangular passage between the 
  arytenoid cartilages, and this produces a hissing sound (see Figure 2.2c). To produce a 
  breathy voice, the vocal cords never close completely but are in vibration; hence, there 
  is a murmuring sound. A creaky voice results from voicing with slow, regular vibration, 
  whereas a harsh voice results from excessive tension in the vocal cords and irregular vibration. A hoarse voice usually results from swelling of the vocal cords producing irregular 
  vibration and incomplete closure.

  . Two other air stream mechanisms may be used in producing certain sounds in other languages, 
  the “glottalic” system and the “velaric” system. In the latter, for example, the tongue is raised against 
  the velum and simultaneously at a point further forward in the mouth, trapping air. Moving the 
  tongue downward rarefies the air, and when the tongue is released, air rushes in to produce an 
  ingressive sound. There are three types of such sounds, called “clicks”, in the Bantu (e.g. Xhosa, Zulu) 
  and Khoisan languages of southern Africa. These include the bilabial click (the “kissing” sound), the 
  alveolar click (the “tut-tut” or “tsk-tsk” sound of disapproval), and the lateral click (the sound made to 
  spur a horse on). Although we use these sounds, of course, they are not regular speech sounds.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 23
  Two other features of sound are loudness and pitch. Loudness is related to the pressure and volume of air expelled; as these increase, the sound becomes louder. Pitch is a 
  matter of the quality of the sound, which is a consequence of the frequency of the sound 
  wave emitted. Every person has a natural frequency and range. Men’s voices tend to have 
  a lower pitch than women’s due to the larger size of their vocal cords, which vibrate more 
  slowly. Pitch can be modulated by altering the tension on the vocal cords and changing their length. Pitch decreases when the vocal cords are elongated and tensed and 
  increases when they are relaxed, hence shorter. Most human voices have a range of about 
  two octaves.
  3. Consonant sounds
  Speech is a phonetic continuum, a continuous, smoothly flowing set of movements, not a 
  set of discrete and isolated movements. It is convenient, however, to segment the speech 
  chain into syllables, and to divide these in turn into consonants and vowels. A syllable consists necessarily of a vowel; optionally, it may begin and/or end with a consonant. A vowel 
  is the nucleus or acoustic high point of a syllable; it is articulated for a longer time than 
  surrounding consonants. While vowels tend to continue the airstream, consonants tend to 
  break it. We begin our study of speech sounds with consonants, since they are somewhat 
  easier to describe. We will look first – in abstract – at how consonants are articulated before 
  examining in detail the specific consonants of English.
  3.1 Classification of consonants
  A consonant is defined as a speech sound which is articulated with some kind of stricture, 
  or closure, of the air stream.
  Consonants are classified according to four features:
  1. the state of the glottis: in vibration (voiced) or open (voiceless);
  2. the state of the velum: lowered (nasal) or raised (oral);
  3. the place of articulation: the location where the stricture or place of maximum interference occurs and what articulators are involved; and
  4. the manner of articulation: the amount of stricture, whether it is complete, partial 
  (called “close approximation”), or relatively open (“open approximation”).
  The term “approximation” refers to the two articulators approaching (or approximating) 
  one another.
  In describing the place of articulation for consonants, it is traditional to list the active 
  and then the passive articulator. Consonants involve a rather large number of discrete 
  places of articulation (see Figure 2.3):
  24 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  1. bilabial: the lips are brought together (the lower lip is active); the tongue is not involved 
  but remains in the “rest position” (its position when you say ah for the doctor) – e.g. 
  the sound of “b” in English;
  2. labiodental: the lower lip is brought up against the upper front teeth; again the tongue 
  is in rest position – e.g. the sound of “f ” in English;
  3. dental: the tip of the tongue (or apex) protrudes between the teeth or touches the back 
  of the upper teeth – e.g. the sound of “t” in Spanish or “th” in English;
  4. alveolar: the tip of the tongue makes contact with or is in close approximation to the 
  alveolar ridge – e.g. the sound of “d” in English;
  5. alveolopalatal: the front, or blade, of the tongue is raised to an area between the 
  alveolar ridge and the palate – e.g. the sound of “sh” in English;
  6. palatal: the front of the tongue is brought up against the palate – e.g. the sound of “y” 
  in English;
  7. velar: the back, or dorsum, of the tongue is brought into contact with the velum – e.g. 
  the sound of “g” in English;
  8. uvular: the back of the tongue touches the uvula;
  9. pharyngeal: the root of the tongue (specifically, the epiglottis) is moved backwards 
  against the wall of the pharynx; and
  10. glottal: the vocal cords, functioning as articulators, make a brief closure.

  Figure 2.3. Some Places of Articulation
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 25
  While the uvular and pharyngeal places are not used for the articulation of English 
  consonants, they are used in other languages: e.g. the uvular for German “r” and a French 
  fricative and the pharyngeal for a fricative in Arabic.2
  Each of the various places of articulation just examined may combine with a number 
  of different manners of articulation to produce consonant sounds:
  1. stop: (“oral stop”) involving complete closure of two articulators with the velum raised 
  (velic closure) – e.g. the sound of “p” in English;
  2. nasal: (“nasal stop”) involving complete closure of two articulators with the velum 
  lowered (“velic opening”) – e.g. the sound of “n” in English; for every stop position in 
  English, there is a nasal articulated in the same position (homorganic);
  3. fricative: (or “spirant”) involving close approximation of two articulators; the air 
  stream is partially obstructed so that a turbulent airflow is produced, resulting in a 
  hissing or rubbing sound – e.g. the sound of “s” in English;
  4. affricate: consisting of a stop released into a homorganic fricative – e.g. the sound of 
  “ch” in English; this sound is analyzed either as a complex or a simple sound;
  5. trill: (or “roll”) involving complete closure alternating intermittently with open 
  approximation, that is, a rapid vibration of the active articulator against the passive 
  articulator (this sound in not common in English except for the Scottish “r” made 
  with an apical trill);
  6. flap: (or “tap”) involving momentary complete closure in which the active articulator 
  strikes the passive articulator only once; it is one strike of a trill and similar to a stop 
  except that the tongue is more tense and controlled than in a stop; and
  7. approximant: one articulator approaches another but generally not to the extent that 
  a turbulent air stream is produced; there is usually open approximation in the three 
  different types of approximants:
  a. lateral: involving complete closure of the central portion of the vocal tract, with 
  the lateral passage of air; the air may pass around the sides with no stricture (open 
  approximation) – e.g. the sound of “l” in English – or, in languages other than 
  English, with some stricture (close approximation);
  b. retroflex: involving the underside of the tongue curling back behind the alveolar 
  ridge towards the palate – e.g. the sound of “r” in English; laterals and retroflexes 
  are called “liquids”;
  .  Two places of articulation may also be used at the same time – what is called “coarticulation” – 
  as in the case of labiovelars, which involve the lips, on one hand, and the tongue and velum, on 
  the other.
  26 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  c. glide (or semivowel): involving a glide to or from a vowel; this sound is articulated like a vowel (with no stricture) but functions as a consonant to begin or 
  end syllables – e.g. the sound of “w” in English.
  3.2 Consonants of English and their phonetic notation
  We will now consider what combinations of voicing, place of articulation, and manner of 
  articulation are utilized in the articulation of consonants in English. Remember that not 
  all possible combinations are used in all languages, though certain combinations (such as, 
  perhaps, a velar trill) might be physiologically impossible.
  As you read the following section, you should consult the consonant chart in Table 2.1. 
  On the consonant chart, following common practice, the places of articulation are listed 
  across the horizontal axis (roughly corresponding to a cross-section of the mouth viewed 
  from the left, with the front of the mouth on the left and the back of the mouth on the 
  right); the manners of articulation are listed along the vertical axis, moving in a rough 
  way from greatest stricture at the top to lesser amounts of stricture as one moves down. 
  Voiceless consonant are listed above voiced ones, where applicable. It is not necessary to 
  specify the state of the velum since all consonants are oral except the nasals. Note that in 
  giving a technical description of a consonant sound, it is traditional to list voicing, then 
  place, then manner; get into the habit of describing the consonants in this order from the 
  very beginning.
  HINT: In learning the sounds of English and, especially, in transcribing English words, you 
  must not allow yourself to be influenced by the written form. Because of the imperfect 
  correspondence between sound and spelling in English mentioned above, the spelling 
  will often lead you astray or confuse you. You must try to function entirely in an oral 
  context. You must also try to say words with a natural and relaxed pronunciation. There 
  is a strong tendency when reading words or saying them in isolation to give them an 
  overly formal and even distorted pronunciation. Try to speak as you do naturally in casual 
  conversation. Do not whisper the words, either, as you cannot distinguish between 
  voiced and voiceless sounds when whispering.
  This section, in addition to surveying the consonant inventory of English, will teach 
  you the phonetic alphabet symbol used to transcribe each of the consonants. We will use 
  the modified version of the IPA used in North America. For the most part, you will be 
  asked to give what is called broad transcription rather than narrow transcription. As the 
  names imply, broad transcription merely records the grosser features of sound, whereas 
  narrow transcription records all the nuances and finer aspects of sound, though not performance factors such as drunken slurs, loudness, and so on. The convention is to enclose 
  broad transcription between slashes, such as /kæt/ for cat, and to use square brackets for 
  narrow transcription, such as [khætÐ].

  In the stop series of English, there are paired voiced and voiceless stops produced in 
  three locations:
  1. bilabial: the voiced bilabial stop /b/ (as in band, ember, mob) and the voiceless bilabial 
  stop /p/ (as in pound, open, coop);
  2. alveolar: the voiced alveolar stop /d/ (as in danger, eddy, loud) and the voiceless alveolar stop /t/ (as in tangle, otter, moat); and
  3. velar: the voiced velar stop /:/ (as in grass, rugged, rug) and the voiceless velar stop /k/ 
  (as in carrot, election, luck).
  As you can see, all stop sounds are represented in the IPA with Roman alphabet symbols. 
  The bilabial stop is made by bringing the lips together, the alveolar by bringing the tip of 
  the tongue up against the alveolar ridge, and the velar by bringing the back of the tongue 
  up against the soft palate. Because the air stream is completely blocked, you cannot actually hear stops until you open your mouth to release them into a vowel. Released stops are 
  called “plosives”. Furthermore, the articulation of stops cannot be maintained; their articulation is instantaneous. Practice saying all of these sounds.
  The stops share certain features. First, the voiced stops are articulated for a shorter 
  period than the corresponding voiceless stops. Compare the final voiced stops in 
  Column 1 with the voiceless stops in Column 2:3
  .  Conversely, as we shall see later, vowels that precede voiced consonants are slightly longer than 
  those that precede voiceless consonants.
  28 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  Column 1 Column 2
  cab /b/ cap /p/
  cad /d/ cat /t/
  rag /:/ rack /k/
  You should find that the final consonants in Column 1 take less time to pronounce than 
  those in Column 2.
  Second, the three voiceless stops have two variants each. Note the following underlined sounds:
  Column 1 Column 2
  spot pot
  steam team
  scud cud
  Column 2 lists aspirated versions of the stops in Column 1; “aspiration” means that you 
  release a small puff of air after articulating these sounds. If you hold your fingers or a small 
  piece of paper in front of your mouth, you should be able to feel, or see, the puff of air. As 
  we will learn in the next chapter, the occurrence of aspiration is entirely predictable, with 
  the aspirated versions occurring word or syllable initially before a stressed vowel.4 In narrow transcription, aspiration is indicated with a diacritic or mark added to the letter, in this 
  case a superscript “h”, hence [ph, th, kh].
  Third, voiced stops may be partially “devoiced” at the end of words; anticipating the 
  following silence, we stop voicing part way through the sound. Devoicing is indicated with 
  a diacritic called an “under-ring” [®]; thus the “b” in rub could be represented [b®]. Or we 
  may simply not release the stop at the end of a word. Try saying rap, rat, and rack without 
  releasing the stops; the words should still be distinctive even though the initial consonant 
  and vowel are the same. Unreleased stops in narrow transcription are indicated with a 
  superscript “corner” [Ð]. Stops are also unreleased frequently before other stops, as in apt, 
  captain, rubbed, rubdown, necktie, act, and mugged. Note that you don’t actually release the 
  [pÐ, bÐ, kÐ, :Ð] here but move directly to the next stop.
  The alveolar stops also behave in several distinctive ways. First, when /t/ occurs between 
  two vowels (in the “intervocalic”: position), as in pity, Betty, little, latter, better, writer, city, or 
  pretty, it is normally voiced in both American and Canadian English, though not in British 
  English. Say the following words and note whether they are homophones for you:
  bitter – bidder atom – Adam
  latter – ladder shutter – shudder
  .  Another place in which aspiration may occur is in final position following /s/ or /f/, as in soft, 
  clasp, risk. We will not be concerned with this environment for aspiration.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 29
  metal – medal petal – pedal/peddle
  litre – leader coated – coded
  wetting – wedding conceited – conceded
  If you have the same sound in both, you likely have either a /d/ sound or a sound called an 
  alveolar flap. This is represented by a “fish hook r” [n]. It is voiced and sounds very much 
  like a /d/, but is more rapid and has more force since the tongue is tapped against the alveolar ridge once rapidly and forcefully. As we shall see below, flapping does not occur when 
  the /t/ or /d/ precedes -en and perhaps not before -el/-le.
  Second, when /d/ precedes the “th” sound, it is often made as a dental stop (with the 
  tongue against the back of the teeth) rather than as an alveolar sound (with the tongue 
  against the alveolar ridge). We do so because we are anticipating the following dental 
  sound (discussed below). Note the different position of your tongue when you say the “d’s” 
  in the following words:
  Column 1 Column 2
  wide /d/ width [d¯]
  bread /d/ breadth [d¯]
  The “d” sounds in width and breadth are much like the dental sounds of Spanish or French. 
  They are represented in narrow transcription with a subscript under the phonetic symbol 
  which looks very much like a tooth, called a “subscript bridge” [d¯].
  The velar place of articulation for /k/ and /:/ in fact ranges over quite a large area of 
  the mouth. We anticipate the vowel that follows and articulate the velar stop either further 
  forward towards the palatal region (as in the first two columns below) or further back in 
  the velar region (as in the second two columns):
  Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4
  gill kill cool goof
  game came cull good
  gad cat coat goat
  A final stop, which is unpaired, is the glottal stop. It is a stop produced by bringing the 
  vocal cords together and blocking the air stream at this point. A glottal stop is by definition 
  voiceless and is represented by /ô/. You will articulate two glottal stops when you say uh-uh
  meaning ‘no’, transcribed /%ôәô/, but none when the word means ‘yes’, transcribed /әh%/. A 
  glottal stop quite often precedes a final voiceless stop, so that trip would be pronounced /trIôp/. 
  Some speakers of North American English and British English produce /ôt/ or /ô/ instead of 
  /t/ before -en or -el/le in words such as beaten, fatten, battle, or bottle. Cockney speakers produce /ô/ alone in final position instead of an unreleased stop after a vowel in words such as rap, 
  rat, or rack and intervocalically where others have a flap in words such as city or pretty.
  The nasal series consists of three nasal consonants articulated in the same positions 
  as the three sets of oral stops. In fact, the only difference between stops and nasals is that 
  30 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  in producing the nasals, the velum is lowered so that air is released through the nose. The 
  nasals in English are all voiced (though other languages have voiceless nasals):
  1. the bilabial nasal /m/ as in mad, omen, room;
  2. the alveolar nasal /n/ as in nose, onerous, loan; and
  3. the velar nasal /ŋ/ as in singer, ring (or the Chinese surname Ng).
  To produce the bilabial nasal, your lips are brought together, as for /b/, but air is allowed to 
  escape through the nose. Note that with the nasals you can maintain their articulation (as 
  long as you have air). The alveolar nasal /n/ is articulated with the tongue in the same position as for /d/. The velar nasal is a bit more difficult to produce in isolation since in English 
  it never begins a word. Put your tongue in position to articulate /:/, but then release air 
  through your nose. In the case of the velar nasal, we encounter our first phonetic symbol 
  not borrowed from the Roman alphabet; it is represented by an “n” with a tail called an 
  “eng” /ŋ/. Another thing to note about the velar nasal is that it is always found before the 
  graphemes k or g, though the “g” sound is usually not pronounced in final position (e.g. 
  anger, sinking, sink, sing).
  As with the alveolar stop, the alveolar nasal may have a dental variant when it occurs 
  before the dental sound “th”. Contrast the “n” sounds in the columns below:
  Column 1 Column 2
  ten [n] tenth [n¯]
  moon [n] month [n¯]
  The alveolar nasal [n] in Column 1 is articulated with the tongue against the alveolar 
  ridge, the dental variant [n¯] in Column 2 with the tongue against the back of the upper 
  teeth.
  Another feature of the alveolar nasals is called “nasal release”. This occurs when the 
  nasal follows a homorganic stop (a stop produced in the same place of articulation), hence 
  the sequences /tn/ and /dn/. In nasal release the stop is released directly into the nasal; 
  that is, the tongue is kept against the alveolar ridge and the velum is lowered. There is no 
  separate release of the stop. Say the following words and note how you move from the stop 
  to the nasal: fitness, catnip kidney, goodnight. In narrow transcription, nasal release is represented with a superscript “n”: [tⁿ] and [dⁿ].
  The next set of sounds is the fricative series. English is unusual among the languages of 
  the world in having a very large and diverse class of fricatives. There are voiced and voiceless fricatives produced in four positions:
  1. the voiced labiodental fricative /v/ (as in virtue, oven, love) and the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/ (as in fool, offer, rough).
  2. the voiced dental fricative /ð/ (as in then, lather, lathe) and the voiceless dental fricative /θ/ (as in thigh, author, froth). The voiced version is represented with an Irish 
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 31
  symbol (adopted by the Anglo-Saxons) called an “eth” or barred “d” and the voiceless 
  version is represented with the Greek letter theta.
  5
  3. the voiced alveolar fricative /z/ (as in zero, ozone, ooze) and the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ (as in sorry, passive, rice).
  4. the voiced alveolopalatal fricative /Š/ (as in equation, rouge) and the voiceless alveolopalatal fricative /∫/ (as in shirt, marshal, rush). These sounds are represented by the /∫/ 
  “esh” (long “s”) for the voiceless fricative and /Š/ “yogh” for the voiced fricative.6
  The labiodental fricatives /v/ and /f/ are made by bringing the lower lip up against the 
  upper teeth, the dental fricatives /ð/ and /θ/ by placing the tip of the tongue near the inner 
  surface of the upper teeth. Dental fricatives are quite uncommon among the European languages and often cause difficulty for nonnative speakers. Even for native speakers, it may 
  be difficult to distinguish between the voiced and voiceless variants. Listen carefully to the 
  contrast in the following words:
  Voiced Voiceless
  bathe /ð/ ~ bath /θ/
  either /ð/ ~ ether /θ/
  then /ð/ ~ thin /θ/
  HINT: One rule of English which may help you in distinguishing these sounds is that the 
  voiced dental fricative is found at the beginnings (word initial) of only certain types of 
  words, namely articles, demonstratives, pronouns, adverbs, and conjunctions, such as 
  the, that, they, there, though, but never nouns, adjectives, or verbs. The sound is found 
  in the middle and at the end (word medial and word final) of all words. There are no 
  restrictions on the occurrence of the voiceless dental fricative.
  The alveolar fricatives /z/ and /s/ are made by bringing the tip of the tongue up towards the 
  alveolar ridge, as with /t, d, n/, but not closing off the flow of air entirely. The alveolopalatal 
  fricatives /Š/ and /∫/ are made by bringing the tongue up towards the region between the 
  alveolar ridge and palate.
  HINT: To feel the difference in tongue position between the alveolar and the alveolopalatal fricatives, say /s/–/∫/ and /z/–/⅜/ in sequence. You should feel your tongue 
  moving back slightly; it is also flattening out a bit. But you should also note a further 
  difference: the alveolopalatal sounds involve quite marked rounding of the lips.
  .  In some analyses, /θ/ and /ð/ are considered as interdental rather than dental. We have opted 
  to classify them as dental since the tip of the tongue typically makes contact near the inner surface 
  of the upper teeth rather than protrudes between the upper and lower teeth.
  . Note that in some transcription systems these two fricative sounds are represented by the Roman 
  alphabet symbols with a diacritic called a “hachek”, a Czech word meaning ‘little hook’; the symbol 
  for the voiceless sound /š/ is called an “s-wedge” and for the voiced sound /ž/ is called a “z-wedge”.
  32 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  While /s/, /∫/, and /z/ are found in all positions in words, /Š/ is restricted in its occurrence: 
  it is never found in initial position in English words, only in French words used in English 
  such as genre.
  As with alveolar /t/ and /n/, the alveolar fricatives may be dentalized before a dental. 
  Note the position of your tongue when you say esthetic or is this; you are likely articulating 
  /s¯/ or /z¯/.
  While English has quite an elaborate set of fricatives, there are some possible fricatives 
  that it does not make use of, such as the bilabial fricatives /φ/ or /β/ (you can make these 
  by putting your mouth in position to say /p/ or /b/ but allowing some air to escape – you 
  will feel a slight tingling in your lips) and the velar fricatives. The voiceless velar fricative 
  /x/ is found in some dialects of English, for example, in the Scottish pronunciation of loch, 
  also in the proper pronunciation of German Bach. English speakers usually substitute their 
  closest sound, /k/, for the latter.
  Fricatives can be divided into two subclasses based on the amount of acoustic energy 
  released in articulating them.
  1. One subclass, the sibilants, is produced by constricting the air and then directing it 
  over a sharp edge, namely the teeth. This yields a sound with more acoustic energy, 
  hence louder and higher in pitch than other fricatives; sibilants are perceived as loud 
  hissing sounds. Sibilants include /s, z, ∫, Š/ as well as the affricates (see below).
  2. The nonsibilants involve constriction of the air but no sharp edge; they are consequently much quieter with less hissing. They include /f, v, θ, ð/.
  Say these different sounds and note the acoustic difference. Sibilants are also differentiated 
  from nonsibilants in that they are made with a groove or slight trough along the center line 
  of the tongue.
  The affricate series consists of only two sounds in English:
  1. the voiced alveolopalatal affricate /dŠ/ (as in jury, lodger, barge); and
  2. the voiceless alveolopalatal affricate /t∫/ (as in chin, pitcher, itch).
  As defined earlier, affricates are produced by articulating a stop and then releasing it into a 
  fricative: you can produce the English affricates by saying the alveolar stops and releasing 
  them immediately into the corresponding alveolopalatal fricative – /d/ then /Š/, /t/ then 
  /∫/.7 This suggests that they are complex sounds. We are interpreting them as single sounds, 
  not clusters, however.8
  . Note that in some transcription systems /t∫/ and /dŠ/ are represented by Roman alphabet 
  symbols with hachek diacritics /č/ and /ˇJ/, called a “c-wedge” and “j-wedge”, respectively.
  . The affricates are treated as single sounds rather than as consonant clusters because they are the 
  only sequences that can occur both word initially and word finally, and they are the only sequence of 
  stop + fricative that can occur word initially (see the next chapter on “Phonotactics”).
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 33
  Affricates, fricatives, and stops all belong to a larger class of sounds called obstruents – 
  so called because their production obstructs the flow of air through the oral cavity. They 
  are grouped together because they behave similarly. For example, as mentioned in the case 
  of stops, voiced obstruents are articulated for a shorter time than voiceless obstruents, and 
  voiced obstruents at the end of words are partially devoiced.
  The approximant series in English includes three sets of quite different sounds all 
  articulated with open approximation (no real restriction on the airflow). English approximants are generally voiced, so it is not necessary to specify this feature in their description. The alveolar lateral, the sound in lick, alloy, mall, is represented by /l/. To feel what 
  the tongue is doing when you articulate this sound, say /d/ and then /l/; you should feel 
  the sides of your tongue drop, allowing air to pass around the sides. There is actually 
  quite a lot of variability in the place of articulation of /l/, that is, in the place in the central 
  portion of the mouth where the air is blocked, ranging from the alveolar to the palatal 
  region. Note the position of your tongue when you pronounce the “l’s” in the following 
  columns of words:
  Column 1 Column 2 Column 3
  leaf loom kiln
  late loan cool
  lack lawn felt
  HINT: Say the words in the three columns above, concentrating on the position of your 
  tongue when you produce the lateral sound. The laterals in Column 1 are produced the 
  furthest forward in the mouth because you are adjusting to the “front” vowel which 
  follows (see the next section on vowels). The laterals in Column 2 are produced further 
  back in the mouth since they precede “back” vowels. Finally, the laterals in Column 3 are 
  produced even further back in the mouth, in the velar region since they follow rather 
  than precede a vowel.
  The words in Column 3 contain what is called a “dark l” or “velarized l”, represented 
  with a superimposed tilde [R]. Another feature of “l” is lateral release, which like nasal 
  release (see above) occurs when the lateral follows a homorganic stop, namely /d/ or 
  /t/. The stop is released directly into the lateral, as in sadly, fiddler, butler, cutlass, 
  atlas; this phenomenon is represented in narrow transcription with a superscript l, [d1] 
  and [t1].
  The second type of approximant is the glide, or semivowel. There are two glides in 
  English; they occur only at the beginning of syllables. The palatal glide /j/ is the sound in 
  yes, canyon.
  9 It is produced by raising the tongue in the palatal region. The velar glide is 
  .  In some transcription systems this sound is represented by /y/.
  34 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  the sound in will, aware; it is represented by /w/. Note that when you say this sound, your 
  tongue is raised in the velar region, but you also have strong labialization, or lip-rounding. 
  For this reason, /w/ is sometimes described as labiovelar rather than simply as velar.
  Now say the following sets of words:
  Column 1 /&/ Column 2 /w/
  which witch
  where wear
  whale wail
  Do you have different sounds at the beginning of the words in the two columns? If not, you 
  are using the sound /w/ in both. But if you do, you are using the sound /w/ for Column 2 
  but the sound /&/ (or “inverted w”), a voiceless labiovelar fricative, for Column 1. That is, 
  your mouth is in roughly the same configuration as for /w/ but with no voicing or with the 
  air slightly constricted at the glottis.10
  The third kind of approximant is the retroflex. The description of the English retroflex 
  is rather difficult, and there is no completely satisfactory treatment. It is probably best to 
  call it an alveolar retroflex: the tongue curls back somewhat, and there is also some amount 
  of labialization. It is the sound in river, area, measure. We will represent it with /r/, though 
  the IPA symbol for this sound is a “turned r” /p/.11 A number of dialects of English are what 
  are called “nonrhotic”, or r-less dialects (including standard British English and the dialects 
  of North American English spoken in New York, the Southern US, and parts of New England). In these dialects, /r/ is omitted preconsonantally and word finally, as in part or far. 
  Such dialects often have a “linking r”, /r/ inserted before a vowel in the next or the same 
  word, as in the idea(r) is. They may also have an “intrusive r”, /r/ inserted preconsonantally 
  after a vowel, as in wa(r)sh. Most dialects of English spoken in the US and Canada, however, consistently retain /r/; they are “rhotic” dialects.
  The last consonant sound is the “h” sound found in hard, ahead. It also poses some 
  difficulty for description. It is often described as a voiceless glottal fricative, since the air 
  is partially obstructed by bringing the vocal cords together producing a kind of rough 
  breathing; this is the analysis of the IPA, and hence /h/ is included on your consonant 
  chart in the appropriate box. It is the only voiceless fricative without a voiced counterpart. 
  Another way to understand the sound is as a kind of voiceless vowel, which is homorganic 
  with the following vowel (in fact, /h/ occurs only syllable initially before a vowel in English). That is, you put your mouth in position to say the following vowel; then you constrict 
  .  In Old English this sound was written hw rather than wh; the Old English spelling fairly 
  closely approximates what you are doing in articulation.
  .  In the IPA, the symbol /r/ represents the “alveolar trilled r” one finds in many languages such 
  as Spanish.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 35
  the air momentarily before setting the vocal cords in motion to produce the voiced vowel. 
  Note the position of your tongue and lips when you say /h/ in each of the following words, 
  each with a different vowel:12
  /h/ + front vowel /h/ + central vowel /h/ + back vowel
  heed hoop
  hid hood
  hate hut home
  head horse
  hat hot
  This completes the inventory of consonants in English. In our discussion, we have also 
  mentioned various phonological processes which alter the basic sound of consonants; we 
  have also discussed the diacritics used in addition to the consonant symbols to denote 
  these processes:
  [®] devoiced
  [h] aspirated
  [~] velarized
  [¯] dentalized
  [Ð] unreleased
  In the following chapter, we will discuss in more detail when and why these phonological 
  changes occur.
  Self-Testing Exercise: Do Exercise 2.2.
  4. Vowel sounds
  Turning now to vowels, we will again consider vowels in the abstract before examining 
  the specific vowels found in English. To adequately define a vowel, we need to look at it in 
  articulatory, acoustic, and functional terms:
  – In articulatory terms, vowels are sounds articulated with no obstruction of the air 
  stream, that is, with open articulation. There is lack of central closure of the air stream, 
  though the tongue may come into contact with the teeth on the sides.
  .  For this reason, /h/ can also be considered a voiceless glottal approximant (it would be the only 
  voiceless approximant), and could be written with the appropriate vowel symbol with a devoicing 
  diacritic [®].
  36 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  – In acoustic terms, vowels are sounds that vary in pitch, which is determined by the 
  quality of the sound wave. Pitch is modified by changing the shape of the resonating 
  chamber (the oral and, sometimes, the nasal tracts) by changing the position and 
  shape of tongue and lips and by lowering or raising the velum.
  – In functional terms, vowels constitute the nucleus, or necessary, part of the syllable.
  4.1 Classification of vowels
  Although there are fewer vowels than consonants, their classification is more difficult for 
  the following reasons.
  – Vowels are articulated not by putting the articulators into discrete configurations, but 
  by shaping the tongue in the mouth. Hence, there are theoretically infinite different 
  vowel sounds, forming a continuum with no distinct boundaries.
  – There is significant regional and individual variation in the inventory of vowel 
  sounds; in fact, phonologically, different dialects of English are distinguished primarily by their inventory of vowels, while the inventory of consonants is quite consistent 
  across dialects.13
  – Authorities differ in their analyses of vowel sounds and in their methods of transcribing vowels; several (not entirely compatible) systems of vowel transcription are currently 
  in use.
  – We can produce acceptable vowel sounds without the full complement of articulatory 
  gestures, for example, with our teeth clenched or without the required lip rounding.
  – Differences in length combine with differences in quality in distinguishing vowels, but 
  it is not always easy to separate these differences.
  – It is quite difficult to pinpoint exactly where the tongue is when a vowel is produced; 
  this is especially true for back vowels. Thus the classification system in Table 2.2 
  below designates the general position of the tongue for each vowel. An exact 
  auditory measurement of any given vowel might place its production in a slightly 
  different area.
  In some respects, however, vowels are easier to classify than consonants. For consonants, we must consider four criteria: voicing, orality/nasality, place, and manner of articulation. For vowels, we need to consider only one criterion: place of articulation. This is 
  .  This book does not include any detailed description of the dialects of English. A comprehensive, 3-volume treatment of the dialects of the English-speaking world is found in Wells (1982). For 
  specific information on British and North American dialects see Hughes, Trudgill, and Watt (2005) 
  and Wolfram and Schilling-Estes (2005), respectively. Finally, for a discussion of issues of “dialect”, 
  “idiolect”, “standard/nonstandard” and the teaching of English, see Chapter 12.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 37
  due to the fact that all vowels are voiced and oral. English does not regularly use voiceless 
  or nasalized vowels.14 Also, in terms of their manner of articulation, all vowels are produced with open approximation.
  The place of articulation of vowels is understood rather differently than it is for 
  consonants. Instead of determining which articulators are used and where stricture 
  occurs, we determine where the highest point of the tongue is during the production of 
  the vowel sound. In articulating vowels, the tongue is primary, though other articulators 
  may change the size and shape of the resonating chamber: the larynx can move up and 
  down slightly, the velum can be raised or lowered (giving one or two resonating chambers), 
  the lower jaw is also raised or lowered in conjunction with the tongue position (moving through the close, half-close, half-open, and open positions as the tongue is lowered). 
  The lips, also in conjunction with the tongue position, can be open and closed, as well as 
  rounded (pursed) or unrounded (spread). The rounding of the lips has the double effect of 
  changing the shape of the opening and lengthening the resonating chamber.
  In classifying vowels, however, it is generally sufficient to talk about the position of 
  tongue. The tongue is convex, with the front and back humped and the tip hanging down. 
  The high point is measured on two axes: a horizontal, or front-back axis, and a vertical, or 
  high-low axis. The vowel chart in Table 2.2 below, which is a schematic representation of a 
  side-view of the mouth (viewed from the left), shows these two axes. The front-back axis is 
  divided into three positions, front, central, and back, which range from the center of the 
  palate to the back of the velum. The high-low axis is divided into from four to six positions, 
  either the four positions of the jaw noted above or two positions in each of three sections, 
  high, mid, and low. We will use the latter classification. There are thus 36 possible vowel 
  positions, including the choice between rounded and unrounded vowels in each position.
  There are two kinds of vowels:
  1. A monophthong is a single or simple vowel sound constituting the nucleus of a syllable. The position of the tongue is more or less static, and there is a relatively constant 
  acoustic property, or pitch, to the sound.
  2. A diphthong consists of the tongue gliding from one vowel position to another within 
  a single syllable; it is produced as one continuous sound, not as a succession of sounds. 
  By definition, a diphthong involves a change in the position of the tongue, and it may 
  involve a change in the shape of the lips as well.
  In articulating diphthongs, we may make use of vowel positions not used in articulating 
  monophthongs. There is quite a large range of beginning and ending points for diphthongs. 
  .  The only exceptions are vowels that co-occur with voiceless stops (and as a result may be partially devoiced) and vowels that precede nasal consonants (and hence are nasalized). These will be 
  discussed in Chapter 3.
  38 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  Because of the movement of the tongue, the articulation of a diphthong, unlike that of a 
  monophthong, cannot be maintained; a diphthong is not necessarily longer (does not take 
  more time to articulate) than a monophthong, though diphthongs are frequently, and erroneously, called “long vowels” in school.
  Diphthongs always make use of one of the two semivowels, /j/ and /w/, hence their 
  name of “glide”; we will, however, transcribe the semivowels in diphthongs using the symbols for their vowel equivalents /I/ and /~/, respectively. The glide component of a diphthong is shorter and less sonorous (hence “lower”); the vowel component is longer and 
  more sonorous (hence “higher”). There are two types of diphthongs. A falling diphthong 
  consists of a vowel portion followed by a glide portion. Because the glide is acoustically less 
  prominent than the vowel, the diphthong is considered to be “falling”; the term has nothing to do with tongue position, which in fact usually rises. It refers to the fall or decrease 
  in resonance. A “rising” diphthong consists of a glide portion followed by a vowel portion, 
  thus consisting of a rise or increase in resonance.
  4.2 Vowels of English and their phonetic notation
  We will now consider which of the possible vowel positions are used in English by surveying the vowel inventory of English and learning the phonetic alphabet symbol used to 
  transcribe each vowel. Combined with your consonant transcription skills acquired in the 
  previous section, you will by the end of this section be able to transcribe entire words and 
  sentences as well as read broad phonetic transcriptions.
  As you read the following section, you should consult the vowel chart in Table 2.2. 
  For ease in learning the sound represented by each symbol, a sample word containing that 
  sound is given on the chart.
  HINT: You might find it useful to memorize the words associated with each symbol in 
  Table 2.2, so that when faced with an unknown vowel sound you can check whether 
  it rhymes with your sample word.
  If no word appears next to a symbol in the chart, this means that the sound does not generally occur as a monophthong in English, but only as the nucleus in diphthongs, which are 
  listed below the vowel chart. In giving a technical description of English vowels, it is traditional to begin with the high-low position, then give the front-back position, and finally 
  list features of tenseness and rounding.
  HINT: Be sure to pronounce all of the sample words carefully. Because of the dialectal 
  and individual diversity noted above for vowel sounds, you might find you do not 
  pronounce all of the words the same way as indicated. Strike out any examples 
  which are not appropriate for you. The vowels given are typical of many dialects of North 
  American English.

  Note: Vowels in parentheses represent the “pure” vowels, which do not typically exist in English. For this reason, 
  no example words are given.
  We will begin with the monophthongs, moving from front to back. The front vowels 
  are produced with the high point of the tongue in the palatal region. The front vowels of 
  Modern English are all unrounded. In the high front area, there are two vowels:
  1. the high front tense vowel, represented with a Roman alphabet lower case i /i/; this is 
  the “long e” sound of words such as heed, he, bead, heat, keyed.
  15
  2. the high front lax vowel, represented with a Roman alphabet small capital i /I/; this is 
  the vowel in words such as hid, bid, hit, kid.
  Try saying the two sounds in succession and note the position of your tongue.
  In the mid front area, there are two possible vowels, only one of which is found as a 
  monophthong in English:
  1. the upper-mid front vowel, represented with a Roman alphabet lower case e /e/; this is 
  the sound in German leben ‘to live’, French été ‘summer’, or Spanish leche ‘milk’. If we 
  compare the French and Spanish words with English ate or lay, we find that the English sound is really a diphthong; the tongue is not in a constant position, but moves to 
  a glide at the end of the sound. Most dialects of English have no “pure e”.
  2. the lower-mid front vowel, represented with Greek epsilon /ε/; this is the sound in 
  head, bed, neck, bet, hair, care. It is a very common vowel in English.
  .  This sound is sometimes transcribed as /iy/ and may be analyzed as a diphthong; however, we 
  will consider it a monophthong.
  40 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  In the low front area, there is one vowel in English: the low front vowel represented by the 
  Old English symbol called “æsc” or “ash” /æ/; it is the sound in words such as lamb, hat, 
  rap, fast, tram.
  HINT: Ash is a ligature, that is, a single letter formed by linking two letters, in this case 
  a and e; you should practice writing ash with a single stroke starting in the upper lefthand corner.
  This sound is very susceptible to regional variation, especially between British and North 
  American English.
  HINT: The front vowels are fairly evenly spaced. Say each of the front vowels in succession 
  from the top. As you do so, notice that your lower jaw drops as your tongue is lowered, so 
  that by the time you reach /æ/, your mouth is open quite wide. You may also notice your 
  tongue moving back a little, as the lower front vowels are articulated a bit further back in 
  the oral cavity than the upper ones.
  The tongue is in the palatal-velar region when articulating the central vowels, all of 
  which are lax and unrounded. In the mid central area, there are four sounds. All of these 
  are “uh” sounds:
  1. the upper-mid central vowel, represented by the Hebrew “schwa” /ә/.16 This sound is found 
  in unstressed syllables only, as in sofa, about, subtract, and offend, and therefore is classified 
  as an unstressed vowel. Note that in the following words, the underlined vowels in the 
  unstressed syllables tend to reduce to /ә/(stress is indicated by the acute accent mark ´):
  catástrophe /æ/ catastróphic /ә/
  depréciate /i/ déprecate /ә/
  locátion /eI/ lócative /ә/
  propóse /o~/ próposition /ә/
  oblíge /aI/ óbligation /ә/
  allége /ε/ allegátion /ә/
  absólve /c/ absolútion /ә/
  As we discuss further in Chapter 3, this vowel also occurs in unstressed words in the stream 
  of speech, as indicated by the underlined elements in the following sentences:
  He and I are ready.
  It’s ten to two.
  Jake’s strong as an ox.
  .  In some transcription systems, the additional unstressed vowel symbol // is introduced to 
  represent the unstressed “r-colored” /ә/ in words such as butter, bitter, persist, and curtail. We have 
  opted not to introduce this additional symbol.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 41
  2. a variant of schwa, the high central vowel, represented by “barred i” /G/. This is the 
  reduced vowel found in very casual speech, as when you say the adverb just (as opposed 
  to the adjective just): compare He just arrived (Adv) and He is a just person (A). You 
  should note that the /G/ vowel in the adverb is somewhat higher. You might also have 
  /G/ in the second syllable in the following words: chicken, women, roses, college, comic, 
  and spinach.
  17
  3. the mid central vowel, represented by a “reversed open e with hook” /зĄ/. This sound 
  occurs only in stressed syllables when followed by an “r” sound, as in herd, her, 
  bird, hurt, pert. When transcribing this sound, the /r/ is not added, for example 
  third /θзĄd/.
  4. the lower-mid central vowel, represented by an “inverted v” /%/. This sound occurs 
  only in stressed syllables, as in cut, bud, hut, putt, mud. This sound is lower and somewhat 
  further back than schwa; in fact, it is sometimes analyzed as a lower-mid back vowel.
  In the low central area, there is one sound, represented with a Roman alphabet lower case 
  a /a/, but it does not generally occur as a monophthong in North American English; it is 
  used as a starting point for diphthongs, as we will see later. It is the sound you might find 
  in German machen. Because it is somewhat further forward than the mid central vowels, it 
  is sometimes analyzed as a front vowel in other systems of transcription.
  The back vowels are all articulated with the back of the tongue in the velar region. In 
  English, the back vowels are all rounded, except one. There are two high back vowels:
  1. the high back tense vowel represented by a Roman alphabet lower case u /u/. It is 
  the vowel sound in words such as who, booed, boot, hoot, cooed, do. Note the strong 
  rounding of your lips when you pronounce this vowel.18
  2. the high back lax vowel, represented by Greek upsilon /~/. It is the sound in hood, put, 
  good, look, could.
  HINT: If you say the high back tense vowel /u/ and then the high back lax vowel /⅝/, you 
  should notice both that your tongue is lower in the second vowel and that your lips are 
  somewhat less rounded.
  Historically, /~/ has become /%/ in many words, so that words which appear from the spelling to contain “short u” do not, such as fun, run, luck, spun, gun, cuff, gull, dull; exceptions 
  are u’s between labials and /l/, /∫/ or /t∫/, which remain /~/, such as full, pull, mull, wool, bull, 
  push, bush, or butcher.
  .  Note that there is a great deal of individual variation as to which unstressed vowel is used. Thus 
  a speaker may pronounce the final unstressed vowel in all these words as either /ә/ or /i/.
  . In some systems of transcription this vowel is analyzed as a diphthong with a following glide 
  /uw/, but we will consider it a monophthong.
  42 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  When we reach the mid and lower back areas, the vowel situation becomes considerably more murky: there is great dialectal differences as to which vowels are found as well as 
  differences of opinion concerning their transcription. In the mid back area, there are two 
  possible vowels:
  1. the upper-mid back vowel, represented by a Roman alphabet lower case /o/; it is the 
  sound in German Boot ‘boat’ or French eau ‘water’, chaud ‘hot’. But it does not exist as a 
  monophthong in most dialects of English, only as the beginning point of a diphthong, 
  the sound found in, for example, boat.
  HINT: As you say boat, you should notice that your tongue is not in a constant position, 
  but rises at the close; your lips will also round more at the end.
  2. the lower-mid back vowel, represented by a backwards c, called an “open o”, /f/. While 
  this vowel is common in many dialects of English, in some dialects, it occurs only before 
  /r/, as in fort, torte, more.
  19
  In the low back area, there are again two possible vowels:
  1. the low back unrounded vowel, represented by a lower case script a /"/. This is the 
  vowel found in father and, for many speakers, also in hot, cod, body, bomb, hard, bard, 
  heart, card. Note that this is the only back vowel which is not rounded. Compare the 
  unrounded /c/ in moss, pot, and gosling to the rounded /f/ in Morse, port, gorse.
  2. the low back rounded vowel, represented by an upside down script a /d/. Speakers of 
  British and Canadian English may have this sound in the words given immediately 
  above, except father.
  HINT: Say the above words and try to determine whether your vowel is the rounded 
  version /d/ or the unrounded version /α/. If you have /d/, then it is likely that /α/ is 
  restricted to the position before /r/, as in part, and to the word father.
  British English and some dialects of North American English distinguish the vowels in the 
  following sets of words, using /f/ in Column 1 and /c/ or /d/ in Column 2:
  Column 1 Column 2
  cawed cod
  caught cot
  auto Otto
  awed odd
  taught tot
  naught not
  .  In some transcription systems, /f/ is considered a low back vowel.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 43
  However, Canadian English and some dialects of US English do not distinguish the vowels.
  HINT: Say the words in Columns 1 and 2 above and determine whether they are 
  homophones for you. Then try to say all the back vowels in order from the top of the 
  chart to the bottom: /u – ⅝ – o – ↕ – α/. Notice how your tongue drops, your jaw lowers, 
  and your lips gradually unround.
  This completes the inventory of monophthongs of English. We turn now to the diphthongs. English has six diphthongs, five of which are falling diphthongs, and one of which 
  is a rising diphthong. As you read the following explanations, look at Figure 2.4, which 
  shows the approximate starting and ending points of these diphthongs.

  Figure 2.4. The Diphthongs of North American English (Approximate Starting and Ending Points)
  1. The low central to high front (lax) diphthong /aI/ is the sound found in hide, high, bide, 
  height, eye, sigh, tired, hire. This sound was probably called “long i” in school, but it is 
  really a falling diphthong ending with a /j/ glide.
  2. The low central to high back (lax) diphthong /a~/ is the sound in how, found, cowed, 
  out, down. Note that your lips round at the end with a /w/ glide.
  There is a phenomenon affecting these two diphthongs which characterizes Canadian 
  English; for this reason, it is often called “Canadian raising”, though it is also found in 
  American dialects, such as those of tidewater Virginia and Cape Cod. In Canadian raising, 
  the beginning point of these two diphthongs is somewhat higher, closer to the mid central 
  44 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  region, so that the resulting diphthongs are /%~/ and /%I/, as in the typical Canadian pronunciations of the following:
  /a~/ > /%~/ out, south, mouse, couch
  /aI/ > /%I/ rice, type, tight, wife
  However, this raising occurs only before voiceless consonants, so that speakers have a contrast between a raised diphthong for the words in Columns 1 and 3 below and an unraised 
  diphthong for the words in Columns 2 and 4, where the consonant following is voiced:
  Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4
  /%~/ ~ /a~/ /%I/ ~ /aI/
  house houses, (to) house knife knives
  mouth mouths, (to) mouth advice (to) advise
  spouse (to) espouse tripe tribe
  lout loud ice eyes
  bout bowed write ride
  3. The (upper-)mid front to high front (lax) diphthong /eI/ is the sound in hay, hate, 
  bayed, mate, gate, late. This sound has traditionally been called “long a”, but it is, in 
  fact, a falling diphthong. This diphthong substitutes for the “pure e” vowel of other 
  languages such as Spanish and French.
  4. The (upper-)mid back to high back (lax) diphthong /o~/ is the sound in bode, hoe, 
  boat, coat, no. Known traditionally as “long o”, it is a falling diphthong ending in a /w/ 
  glide; note that your lips round with the glide.
  5. The (lower-)mid back to high front (lax) diphthong /fI/ is the sound in ahoy, Boyd, 
  boy, ploy. It too is a falling diphthong.
  6. The high front (lax) to high back (tense) diphthong /Iu/ is the sound in hued, cute, 
  cued, few, pure, fury. It is the only rising diphthong of English: it begins with a /j/ glide 
  and concludes with a /u/ vowel.20
  Quite a common phenomenon for many speakers is the loss of the /j/ glide (or “yod-dropping”), that is, a shift from /Iu/ to /u/, what can be called “monophthongization”, after 
  alveolar consonants, as in Sue, suit, new, stew. Note that if monophthongization occurs, the 
  words in Columns 1 and 2 are homophones:
  Column 1 Column 2
  Tue(sday) two, to
  due, dew do
  lieu loo
  sue Sue
  .  In some transcription systems this diphthong is represented as /ju/.
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 45
  In other environments, the diphthong is maintained, as in the words below, where /Iu/ in 
  Column 1 contrasts with /u/ in Column 2:
  Column 1 Column 2
  pew poo
  cute coot
  view voo(doo)
  beaut(y) boot
  few phoo(ey)
  music mood

  Two additional features of vowels still need to be discussed. The first is the feature of 
  vowel “tenseness”. Tenseness is a rather controversial concept, but it is generally thought 
  to refer to the degree of tension in the muscles of tongue, which affects the total volume of the tongue, and is responsible for small variations in vowel quality. Tense vowels
  are longer, higher, and more marginal, while lax vowels are shorter, lower, and slightly 
  more centralized. More importantly, tense and lax vowels can be distinguished by their 
  occurrence in certain types of syllable. An open syllable is one which does not end in a 
  consonant, though it may optionally begin with one or more consonants. A closed syllable is one which ends in one or more consonants; again it may or may not begin with 
  consonants. While both tense and lax vowels can occur in unstressed syllables of any 
  kind and in stressed closed syllables, only tense vowels can occur in stressed open syllables; lax vowels cannot occur in stressed open syllables. Table 2.3 classifies the vowels 
  of English into the categories tense versus lax and illustrates their distribution in open 
  versus closed syllables. Note that the asterisks mark impossible sequences (here, a lax 
  vowel in an stressed open syllable).
  The second remaining feature is that of vowel length, the time spent in articulating a 
  vowel. Unlike many languages, English does not distinguish between long and short vowel 
  pairs. It has been found that syllables in English are always the same length. In other words, 
  they always take the same amount of time to articulate. However, we have already seen 
  above that voiced and voiceless obstruents at the ends of words differ in length, the voiceless obstruents being longer than the voiced. In such cases, in order to compensate for the 
  length of the consonants, the vowel length differs, thus keeping the length of the syllable 
  constant. In Column 1 below, the vowel is followed by a voiceless obstruent, causing the 
  vowel to be shorter and the obstruent longer. In Column 2, the opposite is true: the 
  vowel is followed by a voiced consonant, causing the vowel to be longer and the obstruent 
  to be shorter.

  Note: Vo = vowel, C = consonant, vd = voiced, vl = voiceless
  Final sequences of consonants also take longer to articulate than single consonants, as 
  you would expect (initial consonants seem to have no effect). Moreover, vowels in open 
  syllables will be longer than those in closed syllables. These facts combined give us the following, entirely predictable, sequence of vowel length:
  Long Half-long Short Shortest
  CVo CVoCvd CVoCvl CVoCC
  see seed seat ceased
  lay laid late laced
  mow mowed moat most
  fee feed feat feast
  Note: Vo = vowel, C = consonant, vd = voiced, vl = voiceless
  .  Note that /%/ is the only mid central vowel given in this chart: /G/ and /ә/ are not included 
  since they occur only in unstressed syllables; /зĄ/ occurs only in conjunction with the “r” sound and 
  thus can be analyzed as occurring always in a closed syllable (hence lax by definition).
  .  For speakers who have /f/ only before /r/, /f/ will be lax by definition. 
  Chapter 2. Consonants and vowels 47
  Vowel length may be indicated by diacritics: [˜] for long, [™] for half-long, and nothing or [˘] 
  for short. Alternatively, a macron [¿] may indicate a long vowel.
  5. The function of vowels and consonants
  Speech sounds can be viewed in two ways, either with respect to their form or with respect 
  to their function. Thus far we have discussed the form of vowels and consonants, noting 
  that vowels are articulated with no restriction of the air stream (or with open approximation) while consonants are generally articulated with some restriction of the air stream.
  In order to understand the difference between these two classes of speech sounds we 
  should also consider their function. Vowels have a function that can be described as 
  syllabic: that is, they constitute the obligatory nucleus of a syllable, which consists minimally of one vowel, as in the personal pronoun I /aI/. Vowels are also louder, longer, more 
  sonorous, and acoustically more prominent than consonants. Consonants, on the other 
  hand, generally have a “nonsyllabic” function. Though they can begin and/or end syllables, 
  they are optional. They are also shorter and acoustically less prominent.
  However, we have already seen that the distinction between consonant and vowel is 
  not entirely absolute: glides are articulated as vowels but function as consonants. Further 
  difficulty results from the fact that certain consonants have a “syllabic” function; that is, 
  they are like a vowel in being able to stand alone in a syllable (without any other vowel). 
  These consonants include the liquids and the nasals. They are commonly syllabic following a consonant at the end of a polysyllabic word. We indicate the syllabic function of 
  consonants by a subscript bar [À]. Read the following examples; you should notice that the 
  underlined element may contain the vowel /ә/ or, alternatively, no vowel at all. In the latter 
  instance, the consonant is syllabic, and serves the function of a vowel:
  Syllabic Consonant Examples
  [rŸ ] ladder, butter, runner
  [lŸ] fizzle, muddle, muscle, kettle
  [nŸ] reason, beaten, sudden, and (said rapidly)23
  [ŋŸ ] Jack and Kate (said rapidly), lookin’ good
  [mŸ ] solemn, rhythm, prism, chasm24
  In sum, it is important when distinguishing consonants and vowels to consider both differences in form (i.e. articulated with or without closure in the vocal tract) and function 
  (syllabic versus nonsyllabic). As we have seen, neither vowels nor consonants are entirely 
  .  Note that nasal release and lateral release may yield syllabic consonants. Syllabic [lŸ] and [nŸ] 
  occur following alveolars, but generally not following labials and velars. 
  .  Syllabic [ŋŸ ] and [mŸ ] are rare.
  48 The Linguistic Structure of Modern English
  distinguished by either form or function since some consonants (namely, the approximants) are articulated as vowels with open approximation and some consonants (the syllabic 
  consonants) function as vowels in certain environments.25

  .  Because the traditional classification of sounds rests on both formal and functional criteria, it 
  has proved useful in phonological work to break sounds down into smaller components. These are 
  known as “phonological”, or “distinctive, features”. This alternative way of describing sounds originated in the “Prague School” of structural linguistics which flourished between World War I and 
  World War II. It was promoted in America by the linguist Roman Jakobson and later incorporated 
  into the approach know as “generative phonology” by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle in their 
  influential book, The Sound Pattern of English (1968). While this approach is considered somewhat 
  too advanced for this text, you may find out more about it in Exercise 2.7 and in the sources listed
