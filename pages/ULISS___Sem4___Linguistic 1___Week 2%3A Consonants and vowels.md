# Chapter 2: Consonants and vowels
	- ## 3. Consonant sounds
		- Speech is a phonetic continuum, a continuous, smoothly flowing set of movements
			- not a set of discrete and isolated movements.
		- It is convenient, however, to segment the speech chain into syllables, and to divide these in turn into consonants and vowels.
		- A syllable consists necessarily of a vowel; optionally, it may begin and/or end with a consonant.
		- A vowel is the nucleus or acoustic high point of a syllable; it is articulated for a longer time than 
		  surrounding consonants.
		- While vowels tend to continue the airstream, consonants tend to break it.
		- We begin our study of speech sounds with consonants, since they are somewhat easier to describe.
			- We will look first – in abstract – at how consonants are articulated before examining in detail the specific consonants of English.
		- ### 3.1 Classification of consonants
		  collapsed:: true
			- A consonant is defined as a speech sound which is articulated with some kind of stricture, 
			  or closure, of the air stream.
			- Consonants are classified according to four features
			  collapsed:: true
				- the state of the glottis
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- in vibration (voiced)
					- open (voiceless);
				- the state of the velum
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- lowered (nasal)
					- raised (oral);
				- the place of articulation
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the location where the stricture or place of maximum interference occurs
					- what articulators are involved
				- the manner of articulation
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the amount of stricture
						- whether it is complete
						- partial - “close approximation”
						- or relatively open - “open approximation”
						- The term “approximation” refers to the two articulators approaching (or approximating) one another.
			- In describing the place of articulation for consonants, it is traditional to list the active 
			  and then the passive articulator.
				- Consonants involve a rather large number of discrete places of articulation (see Figure 2.3)
					- bilabial
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the lips are brought together (the lower lip is active); the tongue is not involved 
						  but remains in the “rest position” (its position when you say ah for the doctor) – e.g. 
						  the sound of “b” in English;
					- labiodental
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the lower lip is brought up against the upper front teeth; again the tongue 
						  is in rest position – e.g. the sound of “f ” in English;
					- dental
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the tip of the tongue (or apex) protrudes between the teeth or touches the back 
						  of the upper teeth – e.g. the sound of “t” in Spanish or “th” in English;
					- alveolar
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the tip of the tongue makes contact with or is in close approximation to the 
						  alveolar ridge – e.g. the sound of “d” in English;
					- alveolopalatal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the front, or blade, of the tongue is raised to an area between the 
						  alveolar ridge and the palate – e.g. the sound of “sh” in English;
					- palatal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the front of the tongue is brought up against the palate – e.g. the sound of “y” 
						  in English;
					- velar
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the back, or dorsum, of the tongue is brought into contact with the velum – e.g. 
						  the sound of “g” in English;
					- uvula
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the back of the tongue touches the uvula;
					- pharyngeal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the root of the tongue (specifically, the epiglottis) is moved backwards 
						  against the wall of the pharynx; and
					- glottal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the vocal cords, functioning as articulators, make a brief closure.

				- While the uvular and pharyngeal places are not used for the articulation of English 
				  consonants, they are used in other languages
					- e.g.
						- the uvular for German “r”
						- a French fricative
						- the pharyngeal for a fricative in Arabic
					- Two places of articulation may also be used at the same time – what is called “coarticulation” – as in the case of labiovelars, which involve the lips, on one hand, and the tongue and velum, on the other.
			- Each of the various places of articulation just examined may combine with a number 
			  of different manners of articulation to produce consonant sounds:
				- **stop**: (“oral stop”) involving complete closure of two articulators with the velum raised 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  (velic closure) – e.g. the sound of “p” in English;
				- **nasal**: (“nasal stop”) involving complete closure of two articulators with the velum 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  lowered (“velic opening”) – e.g. the sound of “n” in English; for every stop position in 
				  English, there is a nasal articulated in the same position (homorganic);
				- **fricative**: (or “spirant”) involving close approximation of two articulators; the air 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  stream is partially obstructed so that a turbulent airflow is produced, resulting in a 
				  hissing or rubbing sound – e.g. the sound of “s” in English;
				- **affricate**: consisting of a stop released into a homorganic fricative – e.g. the sound of 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  “ch” in English; this sound is analyzed either as a complex or a simple sound;
				- **trill**: (or “roll”) involving complete closure alternating intermittently with open 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  approximation, that is, a rapid vibration of the active articulator against the passive 
				  articulator (this sound in not common in English except for the Scottish “r” made 
				  with an apical trill);
				- **flap**: (or “tap”) involving momentary complete closure in which the active articulator 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  strikes the passive articulator only once; it is one strike of a trill and similar to a stop 
				  except that the tongue is more tense and controlled than in a stop
				- **approximant**: one articulator approaches another but generally not to the extent that 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  a turbulent air stream is produced; there is usually open approximation in the three 
				  different types of approximants:
					- **lateral**: involving complete closure of the central portion of the vocal tract, with 
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  the lateral passage of air; the air may pass around the sides with no stricture (open 
					  approximation) – e.g. the sound of “l” in English – or, in languages other than 
					  English, with some stricture (close approximation);
					- **retroflex**: involving the underside of the tongue curling back behind the alveolar 
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  ridge towards the palate – e.g. the sound of “r” in English; laterals and retroflexes 
					  are called “liquids”;
					- **glide** (or semivowel): involving a glide to or from a vowel; this sound is articulated like a vowel (with no stricture) but functions as a consonant to begin or 
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  end syllables – e.g. the sound of “w” in English.
