# Chapter 2: Consonants and vowels
	- ## 3. Consonant sounds
		- Speech is a phonetic continuum, a continuous, smoothly flowing set of movements
			- not a set of discrete and isolated movements.
		- It is convenient, however, to segment the speech chain into syllables, and to divide these in turn into consonants and vowels.
		- A syllable consists necessarily of a vowel; optionally, it may begin and/or end with a consonant.
		- A vowel is the nucleus or acoustic high point of a syllable; it is articulated for a longer time than 
		  surrounding consonants.
		- While vowels tend to continue the airstream, consonants tend to break it.
		- We begin our study of speech sounds with consonants, since they are somewhat easier to describe.
			- We will look first – in abstract – at how consonants are articulated before examining in detail the specific consonants of English.
		- ### 3.1 Classification of consonants
			- A consonant is defined as a speech sound which is articulated with some kind of stricture, 
			  or closure, of the air stream.
			- Consonants are classified according to four features
			  collapsed:: true
				- the state of the glottis
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- in vibration (voiced)
					- open (voiceless);
				- the state of the velum
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- lowered (nasal)
					- raised (oral);
				- the place of articulation
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the location where the stricture or place of maximum interference occurs
					- what articulators are involved
				- the manner of articulation
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the amount of stricture
						- whether it is complete
						- partial - “close approximation”
						- or relatively open - “open approximation”
						- The term “approximation” refers to the two articulators approaching (or approximating) one another.
			- In describing the place of articulation for consonants, it is traditional to list the active 
			  and then the passive articulator.
				- Consonants involve a rather large number of discrete places of articulation (see Figure 2.3)
				  collapsed:: true
					- bilabial
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the lips are brought together (the lower lip is active); the tongue is not involved 
						  but remains in the “rest position” (its position when you say ah for the doctor) – e.g. 
						  the sound of “b” in English;
					- labiodental
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the lower lip is brought up against the upper front teeth; again the tongue 
						  is in rest position – e.g. the sound of “f ” in English;
					- dental
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the tip of the tongue (or apex) protrudes between the teeth or touches the back 
						  of the upper teeth – e.g. the sound of “t” in Spanish or “th” in English;
					- alveolar
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the tip of the tongue makes contact with or is in close approximation to the 
						  alveolar ridge – e.g. the sound of “d” in English;
					- alveolopalatal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the front, or blade, of the tongue is raised to an area between the 
						  alveolar ridge and the palate – e.g. the sound of “sh” in English;
					- palatal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the front of the tongue is brought up against the palate – e.g. the sound of “y” 
						  in English;
					- velar
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the back, or dorsum, of the tongue is brought into contact with the velum – e.g. 
						  the sound of “g” in English;
					- uvula
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the back of the tongue touches the uvula;
					- pharyngeal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the root of the tongue (specifically, the epiglottis) is moved backwards 
						  against the wall of the pharynx; and
					- glottal
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  collapsed:: true
						- the vocal cords, functioning as articulators, make a brief closure.

			- While the uvular and pharyngeal places are not used for the articulation of English 
			  consonants, they are used in other languages
				- e.g.
					- the uvular for German “r”
					- a French fricative
					- the pharyngeal for a fricative in Arabic
				- Two places of articulation may also be used at the same time – what is called “coarticulation” – as in the case of labiovelars, which involve the lips, on one hand, and the tongue and velum, on 
				  the other.
				- Each of the various places of articulation just examined may combine with a number 
				  of different manners of articulation to produce consonant sounds:
