# Chapter 2: Consonants and vowels
	- ## 3. Consonant sounds
		- Speech is a phonetic continuum, a continuous, smoothly flowing set of movements
			- not a set of discrete and isolated movements.
		- It is convenient, however, to segment the speech chain into syllables, and to divide these in turn into consonants and vowels.
		- A syllable consists necessarily of a vowel; optionally, it may begin and/or end with a consonant.
		- A vowel is the nucleus or acoustic high point of a syllable; it is articulated for a longer time than 
		  surrounding consonants.
		- While vowels tend to continue the airstream, consonants tend to break it.
		- We begin our study of speech sounds with consonants, since they are somewhat easier to describe.
			- We will look first – in abstract – at how consonants are articulated before examining in detail the specific consonants of English.
		- ### 3.1 Classification of consonants
			- A consonant is defined as a speech sound which is articulated with some kind of stricture, 
			  or closure, of the air stream.
			- Consonants are classified according to four features
				- the state of the glottis
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- in vibration (voiced)
					- open (voiceless);
				- the state of the velum
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- lowered (nasal)
					- raised (oral);
				- the place of articulation
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the location where the stricture or place of maximum interference occurs
					- what articulators are involved
				- the manner of articulation
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- the amount of stricture
						- whether it is complete
						- partial - “close approximation”
						- or relatively open - “open approximation”
						- The term “approximation” refers to the two articulators approaching (or approximating) one another.
			- In describing the place of articulation for consonants, it is traditional to list the active 
			  and then the passive articulator.
			- Consonants involve a rather large number of discrete places of articulation (see Figure 2.3):
