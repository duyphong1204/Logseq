# Chapter 2: Consonants and vowels
	- ## 3. Consonant sounds
		- Speech is a phonetic continuum, a continuous, smoothly flowing set of movements
			- not a set of discrete and isolated movements.
		- It is convenient, however, to segment the speech chain into syllables, and to divide these in turn into consonants and vowels.
		- A syllable consists necessarily of a vowel; optionally, it may begin and/or end with a consonant.
		- A vowel is the nucleus or acoustic high point of a syllable; it is articulated for a longer time than 
		  surrounding consonants.
		- While vowels tend to continue the airstream, consonants tend to break it.
		- We begin our study of speech sounds with consonants, since they are somewhat easier to describe.
			- We will look first – in abstract – at how consonants are articulated before examining in detail the specific consonants of English.
		- ### 3.1 Classification of consonants
			- A consonant is defined as a speech sound which is articulated with some kind of stricture, 
			  or closure, of the air stream.
			- Consonants are classified according to four features
				- the state of the glottis
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- in vibration (voiced)
					- open (voiceless);
				- the state of the velum
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- lowered (nasal) or raised (oral);
				- the place of articulation: the location where the stricture or place of maximum interference occurs and what articulators are involved; and
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- the manner of articulation: the amount of stricture, whether it is complete, partial 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  (called “close approximation”), or relatively open (“open approximation”).
