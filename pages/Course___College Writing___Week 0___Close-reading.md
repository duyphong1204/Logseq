- Question
	- What exactly should I pull out from those references context, and where should I look for each now?
- Reflection
	- It's true that I haven't been reading with references for a while, which is go for the ref first, cause I don't have enough time and prefer to have intertextual view point of my own
	- And I did not get to learn this in highschool, i have to dive into it, learn it on my own when i was in tuyá»ƒn, and in a hard way later
