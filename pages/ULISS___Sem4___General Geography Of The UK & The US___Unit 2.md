	- The British Isles is the geographical term for a group of about 5,000 islands off the north-west coast of mainland Europe between the latitudes of 50°N and 61°N. The largest island is Britain or *Great Britain* which is also the largest island in Europe. It consists of England, Wales and Scotland. The next largest island is Ireland, which is made up of Northern Ireland (or Ulster) and the Irish Republic (also known as Eire). Britain and Northern Ireland, together with a small number of islands, form the United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland, more commonly known as the United Kingdom (which is almost 20% smaller than Italy). In everyday usage, however, Britain is used to mean the United Kingdom [^1] [^2]
