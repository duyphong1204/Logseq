- ## Script
	- Thank you Trang, that was a really informative presentation on the Topography of England, without you, I couldn't know how to start telling my history part. And now, shall we commence on the History of the English Tea?
	- As you already know, the English couldn't grow tea themselves, so how did the tea come to England?
	- So the English tea was Chinese in origin. The Chinese had been developing their tea-drinking ritual for more than 1500 (a thousand and five hundered) years when Dutch traders started bringing it to Europe in large quantities, introducing Chinese tea to the world in the early 1600s (sixteenth hundreds)
	- In 1662 (sixteenth sixty two), there is a Portuguese woman, Catherine of Braganza, who won the hand of King Charles the second and became the Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
	- When she arrived in her new homeland, she brought with her packets of loose-leaf tea in crates labeled Transporte de Ervas Aromaticas, which mean Transport of Aromatic Herbs
		- (there is a theory that this was later abbreviated to T-E-A, tea)
	- She also brought to England the tea drinking experience and popularized the use of porcelain teacups and mugs.
	- Back then, Catherine continued drinking tea enjoyably while tea was only used for medicinal purposes in England. But as the new royal, everything about her, including her beverage habits, was copied by other ladies desperately wanting to be like their idol.
	- And that is how the tea came to England and became popular (but only within the aristocracy).
	- In the mid-1600s, there was a company that was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region, the British East India Company, they dominated the tea imported to England, providing a constant and growing supply of tea, and gradually making England into a tea-drinking nation.
	- By 1700 (seventeenth hundreds), tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of coffee; however, the plant was still only grown in China.
	- And China at that time, they only allowed trade through one port, Canton and would only accept silver as payment for tea, which eventually resulted in England’s silver deposits beginning to run low.
	- So to overcome this, the English suggested trading opium for silvers instead so they could use those silvers to buy tea. Wao! How brilliant they were. Except for the fact it caused a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug. This act then triggered the First Opium War between the two nations. In the end, unfortunately, the Qing dynasty was defeated and they had to cede the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms.
	- At the same time, The British East India Company also wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. Luckily for them, they found tea plants in the Aston province, in India, one of their colonies, but the tea in India was lackluster compared to the Chinese. Consequently, they commissioned the botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation. Well, he succeedded smuggled tea trees and experienced tea workers into the India before the Chinese ever knew.
	- In around 1840 (eigthteenth forty), Anna Maria Russell, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, she introduced the concept of Afternoon Tea as she normally got hungry around four o’clock in the afternoon. She then invited her friends to join her afternoon habits. Moreover, Queen Victoria, a duchess friend, she helped formalize the afternoon tea with her Buckingham Palace tea receptions.
	- In the 1880s (eighteenth eighty) tea rooms became fashionable with women as respectable places to meet their friends for a discreet chat and even discuss politics.
	- Now, let's move to the next part where you get to know how the tea became England's national drink by Thanh
